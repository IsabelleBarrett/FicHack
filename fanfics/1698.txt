How long has it been? I finished this on the 15th of April...I'd be surprised if you even remember me. Hi, Booksnake here, been slithering in the shadows for seven months and now I'm back...

Anyway, I'm here to make an ANNOUNCEMENT!

...THERE IS A SEQUEL!

I have been writing it for months, but since I have a slight inability to...um...plan, and since the plot of my next fic looked a lot more complicated than this one, I decided to get most of the writing over with before I posted. It's a good job I did, because it got very confusing and I ended up changing a lot of stuff early on to fit with where I wanted it to eventually lead.

Which, of course, involves me being evil to our favourite dwarves ;P mwahahahaa!

So if you're reading this, pretty please hop over to "When Gold Bites Back" and feel free to skip the introductory author's note from me because I'm assuming you remember this story well enough to understand what's going on. It's a bit slow to begin with because there is so much scene-setting to do but I'm hopefully going to update often enough that it's not too long before the action starts :)

I just want to also add that you are still allowed your own headcanon of what happens after the last chapter. I just couldn't resist spending a little more time with our favourite characters :D

Love, Booksnake xxx
