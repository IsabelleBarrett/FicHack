


The next day comes with so many strange feelings..Where Team enters inside the bureau with mixed feelings and ACP enters with worried expressions on his face… Obviously, he was so much worried abt Duo's condition… He looks towards all and after receiving so many Good Morning wishes from his team just moved towards his cabin without replying to anyone..Where All can really understand his condition..Bureau environment was really silent… After one hour Abhijeet enters inside the bureau …



All looks at him shockingly… Abhijeet looks at them and asked as


Abhijeet (

All starts looking downward due to embarrassment)

ACP hears this and nodded his head as NO after seeing Abhijeet like this… while others were confused and also sad abt Abhijeet reaction..Abhijeet looks at them and moves towards his desk.. and sat on his chair silently.. he was wearing same dress like yesterday.. in same condition like he was last evening..means Abhijeet was not at his home..his eyes were looking very tired..

ACP: Bas yahi hona baki tha…


And after a second bureau fills with laughing voice..Except Abhijeet and ACP all was laughing badly but stops after receiving an angry glance from ACP…



Abhijeet looks towards all and then towards Bureau entrance and moves back to his desk..All too starts doing their work…but their mind were still thinking abt Daya..the way he left the bureau was quite tensing…



One after the other second Abhijeet was looking towards Bureau entrance. And with time passage he was looking more and more restless..Team members were looking at him and noticing his restlessness well…


Freddy (
murmurs):
Pehla karta waqt sochta nai..pher yun pershan hona ka kye fayda..Hun…
he was looking angry with Abhijeet..was looking not happy with Abhijeet approach..



Here Purvi moves towards Abhijeet..who was looking at PC Screen but his mind was somewhere else..


Purvi (
to Abhijeet):
Abhijeet sir? (
got no reply so little loud)

Abhijeet looks at her unintentionally)

Abhijeet stood up in hurry as..


Abhijeet (

Purvi (
confused):

Abhijeet (

sulky tone)
jaio tum yahen yah file rakh do…


Purvi nodded as yes and After placing file on table moves towards there with smily face..Where whole team smiles too.. After seeing such unintentional reaction of Abhijeet…



Here Outside the bureau..Daya was so much hurt..This time Abhijeet really makes his fun badly..with the help of whom? DCP…? This was so so shocking and enough for breaking him.. he was badly hurt by heart this time..Brutally hurt.. he just sat down on his knees and burst out into tears..After hiding his face with his both hands he just burst out..He was crying loudly..



Daya(crying):
Teak hai Abhijeet teak hai..tum apna gusa ..apna dard nikalo muj par..main manta hoon tuma buht takleef di hai maine bina kssi kasoor ka…tum nikalo apna gusa..muja takleef da kar.. nikalo..par iss taran…maine tuma kssi ka samna beizat tu nai kiya tha na..aur tum na sab ka samna kasa mera mazaq
And he stops..after few seconds..
Maine tu sab tumara liya kiya tha naa yar.. ta ka koi tuma wasa na kaha jasa muja…
He stops due to heavy tears..
bht takleef hoti hai yar..bht takleef…(
crying hardly)

Main Doondna ko zamana main jab Wafa nikla….





Main Doondna ko zamana main jab Wafa nikla….





Pata chala, ka galat laa ka main Pata nikla….





Pata chala, ka galat laa ka main Pata nikla…..





Main Doondna ko zamana main jab Wafa nikla….




Here All were worried abt Daya very much..ACP was looking towards all..but he himself was really worried..he dials Daya's number..but Daya was not attending it…He moves out from his cabin and asked from Freddy as..


ACP: Freddy bahr jaa kar Daya ko dhako.. (
looking At Abhijeet)
bht gusa mein nikla hai wo yahen sa ..pata nai kahen hai..Phone nai uttha raha apna..(
looking at Freddy)
jaio zara bureau ka ass pas dhako..


Before Freddy moves…Daya enters inside the bureau…


Freddy: Sir..Daya sir aye gaya…


All looks at him and takes relieving sigh… ACP moves towards him and looks at his red face…


ACP: Daya tum kahan gaya tha?

Daya (
in low tone):
Sir wo main.. wo bas yahin bahr tak he…Aik zarori call aye gaya tha..
And with down head he moves towards his desk and starts doing work on his pc without looking at anyone..ACP nodded to Freddy and ask him to stay keep quite through his eyes..Do not ask anything from him now … He himself moves towards his cabin after looking at Daya..Whose face were clearly telling everyone that he cries a lot..and his heavy voice was like stamp on it…



Here Abhijeet was looking again n again towards Daya and his face.. Bureau atmosphere was really sad and gloomy now .The Day ended like this without any more stuff..Abhijeet did not tries anything more to expel out his anger.. At night whole team starts moving out from bureau quietly towards their home..Before leaving Abhijeet looks at Daya who was still looking at his Pc or working on it who knows...And then he left the bureau….



Today he moves towards his home.. he was looking very disturb and upset while driving the quills..in Mid way he stops the quills and came out from it …and starts strolling at one side of the road..he really starts taking deep breath.. he was looking much upset…when he got a call..he looks at phone screen and attends the call with…


Abhijeet (
disturb tone):
Haan Tarika bolo?

Tarika (
calm tone):
Hello Abhijeet…kasa ho?

Abhijeet (
bit calm down):
Team hoon main Tarika..

Tarika: Acha yah batio tum na kuch khaya ?

Abhijeet: Nai…abi gher jaa raha hoon…

Tarika: okay..but gher jaa kar kuch kah zaror lana..asa mat soa jana..

Abhijeet (
irritate):
Tarika main koi choota becha thora hoon..jo tum muja yah sab smja rai ho.. Kah loon ga ager man kiya tu..aur soa bhi jayon ga ager nened aye gai muja tu…aur kuch?

Tarika: kye baat hai Abhijeet..(
worried tone)
Ab kye hua hai? Pher sa kuch ho gaya kye bureau mein?

Abhijeet (
angry tone):
Haan..aur ab tu roz hota he raha ga..kyun ka main jo hoon..aur main galat he karta hoon humesha..haina? tuma bhi asa he lagta haina Tarika..?


Tarika who was really not getting what Abhijeet is saying..only tries to to calm down him..bcz not exactly but she knows what's the main reason is…


Tarika: Nai nai Abhijeet..tum sa yah kis na kaha? Acha tum gher jayo aur relax karo..okay…


Abhijeet cuts the call in irritation.. and became more and more angry on himself..Basically he was not realizing that hurting anyone intentionally is a big burden on anyone's heat..And hurting his own heart beat is really liking killing his own heart… instead of this he was continually asking this question from himself that why he is not happy after hurting him..who is nothing for him now..he hates him..Really he hates him? Or trying to hate him?



He hits his hand hardly with quills door in anger..which hurts his already hurt hand badly…With same irritated mood he sat down in quills again and started his journey to moving back to his home..


unintentionally


, he looks at passenger seat and remembers his buddy…


"
Daya subha jata waqt tu tuja quills chalana hoti hai…aur ata waqt asa kye hota hai jo tu front seat par aye kar pehla sa beth jata hai…"


"
Boss jata waqt tu huma jaldi poonchna hota hai humesha bureau..Aur tum tu gari deera chalata ho..aur ata waqt main bht thak jata hona..kam jo bht karta hoon..(naughty tone) tumara jasa thora sirf demag he chalata hoon..hath peer bhi hilana parta hain muja tu…"


"
Daya ka becha.. (he tries to hits him)"


"
Arre boss kye kar raha ho..gari maro ga kye…dhak ka chalao..muja nai (he winks) road pa dhak ka…And he laughs..and after few seconds Abhijeet merges his laugh with him"



Today that laughing was missing in the quills… No more Daya..who always relaxed him with his naughty things in this moving back journey towards home..no more that laughing sound which was soothing for him and always enough to relax him and helps him to forget his all worries..he was habitual to living in that aroma…




Jis ka Ana saa Muqamal ho gai thi Zindagii…





Dastaken Kushiyon na dien thin, Mit gai thi har kami..





Kyun bewaja di yah Saza…?





Kyun Khawab daa ka woh laa gaya…?





Jeeya jo hum..Laga Satam…





Azab wo Asa Daa gaya…..




He reaches at home and looks at it…how much he wants he was missing him at every point..he jerks his head and moves forward and opens the door…when his neighbor came towards him after parking his car…


Neighbor: Abhijeet sir..wo app ka gher ki key Daya sir laa gaya…

Abhijeet (
looks at him):
Daya aya tha kye?

Neighbor: jee sir wo subha he aya tha key li muj sa..main bahr he tha garage mein apna..thora he time main kuch saman laa kar wo nikla..per key muja nai dii..aur chala gaya…maine socha app ko bata doon ga…

Abhijeet (
nodded):
Acha teak hai…
And with sad mood he enters inside the home and switched on the lights… Without looking at anything..he moves towards his room and after changing and taking long shower..He moves back to lounge and switched on the Tv in loud volume.. and moves towards kitchen…looking everything organized like he always arranged everything… he starts making tea…was ignoring each and every thought coming in his mind…


"
Daya yar kabhi tu kuch jaga par rakh diya kar..kabhi tu…"


"
Boss…(totally ignore) tea bana raha ho..bana ka meri coffee bana dana (naughty) main lounge mein hoon…"



Tea pot slips on stove and tea falls on stove..Abhijeet looks at it and in anger put off the stove and moves towards lounge…and after sitting on sofa starts changing TV channels… one after the other he was changing channel but not stopping…


"
Boss..kye channel goomya jaa raha ho..Kssi jaga tu ruko…News he sun lo apni favorite"


"
Kyun sunu..(angry)tum pata nai iss lappy par kye karta rahta ho..aur main yah boring news suno..abi itna Buddha nai hua main.."


"
Tu kye sirf Buddha he news suntan hain… (naughty) acha chalu koi achi si movie lagio..sath main dhakta hain,,,"



He hardly hits TV remote on floor with anger and stood up…after switching off the tv he moves towards his room with same angry mood..he was not understanding he was angry on what..?




Doondta tha aik pal mein, Dil jisa yah soo dafa….





Hay suhana raaz uss bin, Roothi Shaamen Din khafa…





Woh Aya naa laa jaya naa..haan usski yaaden jo hain yahen…




Here in bureau..Daya was sitting and working on pc..ACP after finishing his work came out from his cabin to move back to his home..but before moving out he moves towards Daya…


ACP (
caring tone)
: Daya …

Daya (
looks at him):
Jee sir..?

ACP: tum abi tak yahen ho? Raat ho gai hai..sab chala gaya hain..Chalu gher chlu..

Daya (
looking at file n Pc):
Nai sir..kam bht pending hai mera.. main ajj yahen rahon ga raat mein kam karon ga…

ACP: kam hota raha ga Daya..kal aye ka kar lana kam..Abi chalu uttho…gher jayo..

Daya (
unintentionally):
Gher jaa kar main kye karon ga sir…?


ACP looks at him with pain.. And After realizing Daya changes as..


Daya: Wo..me..mera Matlab hai sir gher jaa kar kye karon ga..wahen bhi tu kam he karon ga na..itna pending kam.. iss sa acha tu hai ka main yahen hi kam kar loon..(
relax tone)
muja acha lagta hai bureau main kam karna…

ACP(
meaningful tone)
: mat takleef do kud ko..aur ussa bhi…
he said so and left the bureau..leaving Daya as it is..who was looking at him with teary eyes… he instantly clears his eyes and starts doing his work once again…


""

hath mat lagna muja..hath mat lagna. Apni had main raho Senior inspector Daya..had main aur Auqat main bhi…jayo yahen sa…meri nazron ka samna mat ana ab kabhi..kyun ka main tuma bardasht nai kar sakta…""



""

Arre Daya tum yun sar jukya kyun khara ho…DCP sir ko koi scene tu kar ka dikayo…""



""

Arre sir app ko tu dhkana chiya tha.. Pagal bhi asa pagal na hoon jasa yah bana raha.. huma bhi bewakoof banaya rakha sir..""



""

haan chalu Daya shabash..itna acting ki hai tu ab kye sharmana…Abb tu tumara (stress) Dad wasool karna ka waqt hai…""




He left the pen on file and falls his head over file and hides his tears with his both hands..which were coming in his eyes again n again after remembering Abhijeet act..and his words were tearing his heart into so many pieces…




Na raasta, na kuchh pataa...





Main usko dhoondhunga ab kahaan..?





Main dhoondne jo kabhi jeene ki wajah nikla...





Main dhoondne jo kabhi jeene ki wajah nikla...





Pata chala ke ghalat leke main pata nikla...





Pata chala ke ghalat leke main pata nikla...





Main dhoondne ko zamane mein jab wafa nikla...





Main dhoondne ko zamane mein jab wafa nikla aa…..




Here Abhijeet really tries to close his eyes and to sleep… but failed all the time..he was looking very restless all the time.. but trying again n again to sleep anyhow…He was changing his sides again n again in restlessness...




Main Doondna ko zamana main jab Wafa nikla….





Main Doondna ko zamana main jab Wafa nikla….





Pata chala, ka galat laa ka main Pata nikla….





Pata chala, ka galat laa ka main Pata nikla…..





Main Doondna ko zamana main jab Wafa nikla….




Next Morning came on their way…One after the other all came in bureau except ACP and Abhijeet and found Daya sleeping on his desk..Resting his head on files..when they moved to wake him up…They found him unconscious…
