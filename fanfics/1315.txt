Sorry. I'm not going to be able to update until I at least get a new computer. My house was recently on fire and I lost absolutely everything. It is taking me and my family a while to settle down.

I also have a lot of summer homework and moving around to worry about.

I'm sorry if you were excited about a new chapter, but I just wanted to tell you guys. As soon as I get a chance to write a new chapter, I will replace this update with it.
