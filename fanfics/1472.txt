But first I have to put this out there: If you want to have your Shipping pairs in this story either PM me or leave your list in a review… I know this is a really strange request but I have a good reason… Also if someone else gives me a shipping pair I don't care I want every single one you have. If you love this enough tell your readers I will probably never complete this story for only one reason... All of you sending me your shipping pairs I will love to have repeats! The rating will all depend on you my readers.
This is not just books this is everything I just didn't know what category to put this in!


Oh I know! Get shipping pairs from your friends and have them make a separate list and send that to me then I will
ONLY
need their first name so I can name the chapter after them! I am doing this with all my friends also… My chapter will be the first one up so get ready for the ride of your life!
