It'll be set in the current season and I can't wait to get caught up. As for the romance, I don't know if Laci will be getting one this season. Her two love interests are both not on the show anymore. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them. The new story is called Sleeping Angel. Thanks so much for reading and I hope to see some old faces reviewing for the newer edition to this story.
