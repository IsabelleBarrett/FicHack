"Love can not be stopped but can be hidden.'Angela replyed.
"I still have the locket Peter."Angela remarked.
"True and it still isn't as beatiful as you."Peter said and smiled looking at Angela's necklace.
'Thank you Peter."Angela said and smiled.
"It's late we better get going Angela."Peter said
"Okay."Angela said still smiling.
Peter took Angela home and something strange happened the next day...
"Hey guys anyone call today?"Peter asked hoping Angela had called.
"Nope no Pete." Ray replied.
"You sure?Maybe someone named Angela?"Peter asked again.
"Angela?whos' that?"Ray asked confussed.
"The girl I went on a date with last night."Peter asked now he too was confussed.
"NOpe sorry Pete maybe you need a good rest."Ray said walking away
"What...what do you mean you don't..."Peter trails off and he heads back upstairs.
He walked into the bedroom. Laying on his pillow was an elvope with Peter's name on it.
He pick it up and opened it.
Dear Peter,
Sorry that I had to meet you and leave like that. But I could not stay any longer. I am
sorry. But I am dead..as you can guess but the fact no one remembers me..Maybe we'll meet again
someday...
-Angela
Peter sat on his bed clinching the note in his hand.
"You had to leave me again. Didn't you?"Peter said angryly, tears slide down his cheeks and dripped
onto the elvope which held the note.
The elvope fell to the floor with a clang. Peter then pick the elvope up, inside was Angela's necklace.
He took it out and put it on.
"We'll meet gain Ange..."Peter said sadly.
Angela floats invisable in the air.
"We will meet gain, I promise Peter."She said sweetly and completly dispears.

The End..for now
