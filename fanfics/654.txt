


To Return To Sacramento



It was the next morning as the members of the Chan family were getting their suitcases loaded into the Chan van.



The twelve sisters were sobbing their eyes out because each of them had formed a new friendship and they did not wish to lose that bond.



Rinrin gave Alan a special cellphone, Aria gave James her special ribbon that was given to her by Wataru.



Haruka gave Stanley one of her arrows.



Each sister gave the respected Chan family member something to remember them by.



Until at last, it was Marie's turn to present Henry with a gift.



"Here, Honorary Brother," Marie sobbed bitterly. "this pink seashell is for you."



Henry took the seashell from Marie's hand.



"Thank you, Marie," Henry said. "I will treasure this seashell for eternity!"



"Will you please sing to me?" Marie asked Henry.



Henry cleared his throat and began to sing.



Henry:


La-la-da-da-da-da;





La-la-da-da-da-da;





La-da;





Well;





You've led me;





On a dizzy chase;





Going round in circles;





From place to place;





I know where;





You're going;





I know where;





You've;





Been;





Better watch out now;





Cause I'm closing in;





Oh;





Wonderful sister;





You;





Can't run away;





Wonderful sister;





You'll be;





Well;





Someday;





I'm on your trail;





Bet you can't;





Hide from me;





Cause when I;





Catch you;





I will;





Set you free;





La-la-da-da-da-da;





La-la-da-da-da-da;





La-da;





La-la-da-da-da-da;





La-la-da-da-da-da;





La-da;





Wonderful sister;





You;





Can't run away;





Wonderful sister;





You'll be;





Well;





Someday;





I'm on your trail;





Bet you can't;





Hide from me;





Cause when I;





Catch you;





I will;





Set you free.




After the song ended, Charlie honked the Chan van's horn.



It wasn't too much longer that the members of the Chan family as well as Jasmine &amp; James were bound for their homes in Sacramento California.
