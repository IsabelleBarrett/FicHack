Jays POV


I remember the first date we had and she looked amazing in her red dress the others had upset me when I had to take her to a amusement park we looked stupid being all dressed up to go to a amusement 's when I found out she was the Samari I was surprised but it only turned me on more that this girl could fight. I remembered what the evil me said "did I mention that I kissed Nya I was so angry that I could swear I kicked him into the next world. Then I heard someone say "Jay Jay" my thoughts came back into the real world and saw everyone laughing at something Lloyd had said I then saw Cameron scratching his head so I asked him "hey what's wrong with you acne troubles kid?" He then took Coles duck chowder and dumped it on my head then walked out everyone started laughing I got up and turned on the water to the shower and scribes my hair clean with shampoo till my hair turned back to the natural brown color Nya loved instead of the red color that made me look like Kai I then put some casual cloths on until I had time to clean my ninja suit I then walked out on the deck of the bounty to see Nya and Cam chatting he saw me and said "what I'm sorry Jay" I walked up and said "ok I forgive you" Nya then pulled me into a kiss then took my arm and lead me to the edge of the bounty she then looked at me and I nodded and she made me jump off the ship we landed at the movies. We walked in and I bought us some tickets Nya wanted to see lone survivor I didn't know why but I was happy to see a action movie. We took our seats and watched the movie I was amazed at how graphic it was but Nya just smiled then placed a kiss on me I melted into the kiss I never knew why but Nya's lips were so soft and for some reason they tasted like cherries but she never wore makeup she pulled her lips away from me and I whispered in her ear "I love you so much Nya" she smiled and rested he read on my chest after the movie ended we left and went back to the ship I was surprised that Nya had moved into my room we could now do anything without having to worry about THE RATH OF KAI. We walked into the room and I put on my blue and white stripped pajamas *looks over at the reader* "don't judge me for wearing pajamas". I got under the covers and Nya laid next to me and snuggled her face in my chest I was feeling hot because the combined heat of me and her under the blankets was hot I started to fall asleep and saw Nya's eyes closing so I did the same and fell asleep.
