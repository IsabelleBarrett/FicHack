Finally Scotty entered the deck reading his PADD. His brow was furrowed and the engineer didn't notice the romantic setting until gently removed the device from his hands.

"Ah love the surprise" Scotty said, kissing Bones.

"I'm glad you like it" Bones replied leading Scotty to the table. Once they were seated Bones' nerves came back in full force and he decided not to wait any longer.

"Monty, we've been together for 11 years." Bones started.

"Aye, we have." Scotty agreed.

"Please let me finish. I feel as if I'll lose my nerve if I don't say it all at once." Bones said. Scotty kept his mouth shut but nodded encouragingly.

"We've had our ups and downs over the years. Been through hell; almost lost each other." Bones said a little unevenly, he still had nightmares of Scotty's wet unbreathing form.

"Honestly I've waited too long to do this and I understand if you say no." Bones rushed out. This was it. The moment of truth.

"Montgomery Scott will you marry me?" Bones asked pulling the ring he had Keenser make out of his pocket and presented it to Scotty.

Scotty gasped and was silent for a few moments that it made Bones heart race.

"Yes" Scotty answered.

"Yes?" Bones replied incredulously.

"Yes you daft bastard." Scotty confirmed before pulling Bones into a passionate kiss.

A few moments later there was a ship wide announcement made by the Captain.

"Attention all personnel of the Enterprise. I am pleased to announce that our esteemed Dr. McCoy and Head engineer Mr. Scott are now engaged."
