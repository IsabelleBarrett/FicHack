

Hello everyone. Sorry, but this is not an update. I am currently planning on starting fresh with my stories since when I first made these, they really had no outline and my interest in

writing

about both Bleach and Sword Art Online have all but gone extinct. Henceforth, I am going to make some new stories with subjects I am now

really

involved in. An example is Naruto and Kingdom Hearts. Hopefully, you can expect a story soon and I apologize greatly for this sad news. Still, I shall leave them up and if any are interested, they may adopt the stories from me. As long as they give me credit and PM me first. That is all, and thank you for understanding.


~~~Sincerely~~~
