So now you've had a glimpse into my life as a teenager. Was it fun? I don't know, honestly, being a teenager was depressing at times. But you saw what I meant in my first note when I told you that life is not one story, but a collection of stories. Everything is connected.

Will you stay with me, and listen to the next iteration of my stories? Will you follow me and my friends through the rest of my collection of short-stories? Or have you had enough? That's fine, if you have. Don't worry, I'm not mad if that's the case.

But please, let me know what you thought of my journey from being a depressed, suicidal 17 year old to being a strong, proud 19 year old.

All I know is that my story isn't over yet. My collection of short-stories has only just begun.

-Eliza



A/N: So.



The Changeling's over, guys! Can you believe it? But you heard Eliza, this Elizaverse isn't over yet.
