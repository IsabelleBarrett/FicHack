Thank you all again very much for your support! I hope you all enjoy the rewrite as much as you've loved the original! To those who are worried about me taking this one down, don't. I plan on marking this story as 'Complete' even though it is technically 'discontinued' when really, it is continued on in "Rewrite: I'm A What?". It may take me a while to get to the last chapter I've posted on here, but I will get there eventually and actually continue it from there!





Thanks again!
