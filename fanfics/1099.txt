By Andy Prosser

The waves beached at the sand for splash. Jeffrey looked acroos the ocean seas.

Clunk clonk. He heard a sound! "Dang Amanda my sister why are you making such the noise?"

"I'm sorry Jeffrey it's just I'm so bord of here"

"We will wait longer for the arrival" Jeffrey was waiting for a pelican to deliver the message of safety. The saftey was his parents it'ds how he hoped they were.

Then there was a crying. "HOw is that commotion?!" he yells at all the nonsense. The racket was so loud so they looked at a baby whale had washed up on the beach.

It is time to save beby whaels!

"We should raise him as a pet" "That's such a good idea that I'm going to do that"

"WHat do we name him" said Amanda sister. I'm going to call him Free Whaley.

No that is a stupid name I hate you. Said "Jeffrey" "It's Free Willy" after our dad who is dead now because the pelican finally delifered the message.

"How unfortunate!" - Amanda

Just tshen there was a nother cry at the ocean. It was sad mom whale!

"Oh no she misses her baeby!" sadded Amanda

"Well that's to bad" said Jeffrey

"Please, Jeffrey, have a heart. Don't you remember how much you missed you're parents!?"

"That's true I never looked at ti like that." And Jefferey let the whale go. Then the pelican came back and said there was an accounting error and their parents were still alive after all.

THE END
