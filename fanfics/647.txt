Ricky's POV

Well its official Lucy and I are going to a another movie premier but this time it's in New York and the movie is called the bull staring Ricky Ricardo and I couldn't be happier

Lucy: Ricky come on we're going to be late

Me: Okay Lucy I'll be there in a moment

I guess you could say that we had a wild trip and it worked out for the better both for us and the mertzes California is our second home and we will forever be grateful
