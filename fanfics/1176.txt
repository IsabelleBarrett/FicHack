==={*WHY CHEESE?*}===

Buff stood there, talking to the young man obviously trying to win her
affections. There was a long awkward silence, broken by Riley hold up a
cheddar cube on a tooth-pick asking

"Cheese?"

Buffy gave him a forced smile and tried to think of a way to escape this
stupid situation. {Why do I even bother to date anymore?} she asked her
self, {You'd think I'd have learned to give it up by now!}

==={*Male Mope-Fest 2000*}===
Meanwhile Willow was more towards the back of the house where the music
wasn't so loud. She needed to think. She was tired of sitting back and
watching Buffy get hurt. She had done it for too long, and she felt even
worse this time.

This time, she was helping the future-heart-breaker. She had warned him
about hurting her best friend, but she had left out the fact that she too
was in love with the small blond. How could she not be? Who walked the
face of the earth and didn't adore the tiny (yet deadly) Slayer.

"Buffy." She sighed, thinking about when they had first met. She
remembered hearing Cordelia making fun of her, and looking up into the face
of the girl that had tortured her all though her childhood. Then, when
the verbal blows became apparent, the shy computer geek had noticed the
blond girl standing next to Queen C.

She was so taken aback by the offended look on the new girl's face that she
forgot that saying anything to the May Queen would only result in more
jokes about her clothes. When Cordy kept making fun of Willow the witch
remembered how Buffy's apologetic stair fallowed her down the hall. She
too couldn't help looking back at the beautiful new sophomore.

From that first moment, Willow knew that there was something special about
the new addition to her grade. No one in her life had ever cared what
Cordelia had said to her besides Xander and Jessie (though Jessie never
really cared, he was too busy drooling over The Queen). She walked out
side and into the cool night air. She heard light foot-steps behind her
and turned around. Speak of the Slayer!

Buffy came running up behind Willow, trying to catch up. As soon as she
did she linked arms with her best friend, smiling sadly.

"I'm sorry Wills," she started, "I thought you'd enjoy being out at a
party. I should have remembered: major mope-fest, THEN partying!" the
blond gave the little witch's arm a squeeze, "I'll give you your time to
mope, as long as you don't go all Neanderthal on me." Buffy gave her best
friend a wink, causing a blush in the copper-topped co-ed.

{Willow always blushes when I bring up my short lived encounter with the
Mesozoic era . . .} Buffy thought, {Wonder why that is?}

Little did Buffy know what had happened during her evolutionary vacation.
The two friends, both feeling lonely, had ended up finding comfort in each
other that night. The cursed beer had effected Buffy's memory though, so
only Willow could remember it. They hadn't done much, but what little
they did meant a lot to the shy Witch. More then she could ever let Buffy
know, even if she did remember. {And she never will remember.} she
thought sadly, {Oh Buffy! Why can't you love me?}

"What's the plan tonight? Rent movies with NO men in then so we don't have
to see what we're missing, or rent sappy teen Vids that defy reality by
starring men with feelings?" Willow smiled, but couldn't bring herself to
laugh. It was too soon to laugh, and to hard to try.

"No men I think. Then maybe move on the teen ones another night." Willow
rested her head on her friends shoulder, wishing for the pain to stop.
She just wanted to be happy again. She hopped that a night with her
favorite slayer would be enough to keep the agony at bay for a while.

Buff reached up and stroked the witch's hair. The soft touches and
Buffy's arm in hers made Willow want to cry. She had set Buffy up. With
another man, and she knew that her heart would break when she realized that
Riley could never fill the shoes of her Angel. She knew that Buffy wanted
a normal life so badly, and her finding out that she couldn't even have a
normal boy-friend would only make it hurt more later.

"So," Willow said, steadying her voice, "How you chat with Riley go?" Buffy
chuckled.

"God!" she laughed, "That guy is so . . . dull!" Willow's head shot up.
That was not the answer she had expected.

"What do you mean?"

"Will, you of all people should know my taste in men! Parker was a fling
that I wish to forget FOREVER," she said, growling the last word, "and I'm
not looking for another Angel. Vamps are so last season! I wanted
normal, but that doesn't mean BORING!"

"You really think he's boring?" she asked, sounding disappointed (though
relieved that Buffy wouldn't have to have her heart broken later).

"I would rather sit threw 100 Giles-lectures instead of listen to Riley
talk about cheese." Buffy laughed, thinking that must sound a little crazy
to her friend. Willow smiled internally. She had set Riley up too.
Buffy did like cheese, but how much can two people really connect over a
dairy product? Willow thought Riley was nice, and though she though he
could have made Buffy happy, she didn't want to make it too easy for the
guy.

"I kept waiting for him to ask me to dance, but he never did."

"He can't."

"Well," Buffy said in finalized tone, "That's the clincher. If the man
can't dance, he's off my list!"

"I'm starting to hate men in general. They're all after one thing!"
Willow huffed, "And then once they've got what they wanted or found
something better they rip out your heart and do the lambaste all over it
wearing golf shoes!" she yelled.

"I know Will," Buffy told her friend, "You're talking to a girl with a hole-
y heart. Angel, Scott, and Parker, remember? No need to remind this
Slayer." Buffy gave Willow another squeeze and put the Wiccan's head down
on to her shoulder.

"Men suck." She muttered, enjoying the comfort of Buffy's closeness.
Buffy wrapped her arm around Willow's waist.

"Yes they do. You just vent, you're entitled to hate." The slayer started
petting Willow's hair with her free hand again. "I'm gonna neuter Oz when
he gets home. He made my Willow cry."

"It's not Oz's fault," said a teary red-head.

"But I wanna hurt him!" Buffy said, sounding like a child who was told they
couldn't have a cookie. "It's not your fault Willow. He did stupid Male
things and he took off. He ran off when he should have stayed and worked
things out, and for that I will never forgive him." Willow sobbed quietly
during Buffy's tirade.

"But it must have been my fault!" she said dejectedly, "I wasn't enough to
keep him happy. If I was then he wouldn't have gone to Varuca."

"Hey!" Buffy stopped walking and took Willow's shoulders, looking the witch
in the eye. "You are more then enough for any man! Oz just didn't realize
what he had." She pulled Willow into a tight hug as she cried.

"It's okay. It's gonna be alright. I know it hurts, but it doesn't last
forever." Buffy whispered into her friend's ear. Willow drew Buffy
tighter to her, wishing that things were different. The slayer pulled
away smiled sadly at her friend. "Come on. Movies with out men await!"

"Fried Green Tomatoes here we come." She mumbled sadly.

"That's the spirit Will." Buffy quickly grabbed the red-head and threw her
over her shoulder.

"Ahhh! Buffy!" she screamed, "What are you doing?!" Buffy pulled Willows
arms around her neck, and grabbed he knees, forcing her into a piggy-back-
ride.

"Buffy express Wills! Next stop; DORM ROOM!" with that she started
running at Slayer Speed towards the girl's room. For the first time since
Oz had left, Willow laughed. In fact she was cracking up as they ran threw
a crowd of co-eds leaving a party.

"Buffy you're crazy!" she giggled as they passed the book store.

"That's not crazy!" she yelled sounding mischievous, "THIS IS!" and with
that she did a flip, landing perfectly. Willow screamed even after they
had return right side up. She held tightly on to Buffy, enjoying the feel
of the Slayer's curves against her body. The trip up the stairs to their
room was intense. They both bounced laughingly, causing Willow's front to
rub up Buffy's back. She was more then a little turned on and she could
feel her body start to react.

As soon as they had walked in the door, Willow hopped down. She didn't
want Buffy to see her flushed face and huge smile. She was supposed to be
moping, and if Buffy saw her happy, then they wouldn't get to spend sad-
girl-time together. Then she remembered shy she was sad: Oz had cheated
on her and left town.

"So, I heard a vote for Fried Green Tomatoes?" Willow nodded sadly and
sank down on her bed. Buffy sat next to her, trying to figure out how to
comfort the girl. They sat together silently, both wishing terrible
things on Oz.

"Hit him over the head with a stick." Buffy suggested, breaking the
silence, "It's surprisingly therapeutic. Gives you a great since of
closure."

"I'll hit home over the head with the whole damn tree!" the witch mumbled
to herself, forgetting about Buffy's Slayer hearing.

"There's the Willow I know and love!" she gave the girl a gentle cuff on
the back and got up.

"You gonna go get the movies?" Willow asked, still sounding kind of down.

"Yup. Movies, Mayhem, and Mochas. Sound good to you?" Willow smiled,
and the Slayer took that as a yes. As the Slayer headed out to the
campus' Blockbuster, Willow rolled onto her back and though about life.
"DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO COMPLEX?!" she wondered aloud.

==={*Clues For Sherlock*}===

Buffy's mind was more then a little jumbled as she walked out of the dorms.
 {What was that all about?!} she thought. There was something going on
with Willow that she didn't understand. How did Willow even know that she
had talked to Riley, and that he couldn't dance? And why did she sound
disappointed when she had said he was boring? There was something amiss
here, and she was going to figure out what.
Buffy wasn't looking for a new Boy-friend right now. She had just been
dumped by a guy that had used her, and her best friend was grieving over a
freshly lost love.

{Or was she?} Buffy wondered. {Was it just me, or did Willow say that she
now hated all men?} Buffy had noticed a few things tonight. For one
that she seemed to be more angry at Oz then Willow was. {But then again,}
she thought, {I never loved Oz.}

She walked along the sidewalk slowly, taking her time, knowing she had a
lot to think about. Buffy had been feeling odd lately. She had been
noticing things she hadn't even bothered to see before. For instance: The
fact that Willow could manage to be radiantly beautiful even first thing in
the morning. Or that she had felt incredible against Buffy's back as they
ran around the campus earlier.

Not to mention the fact that Buffy's super senses could smell the Witch's
arousal when they reached the dorm. {I knew I'd been rubbing against her
as we ran up the stairs, but I didn't realize how much!} she thought.
Buffy had a crush on Willow, but she hadn't quite realized it yet. She
had loved the girl so much, for so long that she hadn't even noticed it
once that love had changed.

Buffy wandered along the path to the rental shop, not really paying
attention until she felt all her hairs stand on end. {VAMPIRE!} She
thought, and like clockwork a newly risen nasty popped out of the bushes at
her. She pulled a stake out of her sleeve, and plunged it into the undead
heart. She waited for the dust to settle before walking again.
