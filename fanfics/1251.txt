In the Teaser: At the Sochi 2014 winter Olympic Games the audience and judges are all frozen solid in ice. All of sudden Ice-solina came out from the fog with angle wings on her back skating around the ice rink doing a figure eight, she then skated backwards and did a triple spin in the air and suddenly fall and landed on her butt.

Ice-Solina

Man I never get the landing right.

Ice- Solina then skated over to the judges table and take the Gold metal.

Ice-Solina

No matter the Gold Metal belongs to me now.

All of a sudden the Spies, along with Orion and Rocket Red came crashing down from the ice ceiling.

Rocket Red

Sorry Ice-Solina but in the name of Olympic sports you must play fair and square.

Sam

Ice-Solina you are freezing the audience and the judges and the other Olympic ice skaters so you can cheat your way into getting the Gold Metal ah.

Ice-solina

Yes I am.

Orion

You know in the Olympic, the world comes together to compete for first place but in this cast you don't like the Olympic after all.

Ice-solina

You're right I'm just here to take the metal.

Suddenly ice soldiers came out from the ice fog.

Alex

Ok having Ice Soldiers at the Olympic doesn't count.

Ice-Solina

Of course it doesn't I made them to destroy you attack them.

All of the Ice Soldiers charged at the Spies, Orion and Rocket Red, but Rocket Red uses his flamethrower at the Ice Soldiers. The Ice Soldiers shield themselves from the blaze, Sam Clover, and Alex leaped over Rocket Red and kicked the Ice Soldiers breaking them into pieces, but the Ice Soldiers reassembled.

Sam

Wow looks like the Ice Solider reassembled.

Ice-Solina

You like I made them myself so if anyone of them gets broken they reassembled.

Orion punches 3 ice soldiers but suddenly the soldiers all reassembled and one of the ice soldiers behind him punched him knocking off his helmet.

Orion

Ice-Solina is right if we break up more Ice Soldiers they'll reassembled back together.

Clover

Hay How about us could try melting them, and then vaporizing them with your laser.

Rocket Red

I don't know my flamethrower can only up temperatures of 5,000 degrees.

Alex

How about the upgrading laser Curling Iron shall double the heat on your flamethrower.

Rocket Red

We'll give it a try.

Alex zapped Rocket Red's flamethrower, and Rocket Red uses it to fire it at the Ice Soldiers causing more than the Ice Soldiers to melt but also melting the ice around the frozen audience and the judges.

Ice- Solina

NO you are ruining everything.

Orion

How about a tease of your own medicine.

Orion fired his ice laser at Ice-Solina freezing her in a block of ice. The Audiences and the judges we're free and cheered for the Spies, Orion and Rocket Red.

Sam

Orion I didn't know you have a freeze ray.

Alex gave Orion's helmet back and Orion puts it on.

Orion

Well Arnold upgraded my equipment this morning so I'll tell him that the ice ray worked.

Moments later the WOOHP agents took the Frozen Ice-Solina away.

Jerry

Another job well done spies, and thanks for your help Orion and Rocket Red.

Orion

Hey we're allies we help each other.

Rocket Red

And with the Gold Metal back for the Winter Games the Olympics shall continue without any other interruptions.

Suddenly a big crash happened outside. The Spies, Jerry, Rocket Red and Orion head outside to see what the problem was and saw that there was a giant Snowman heading towards Moscow.

Sam

It seems that a giant snowman is headed to Moscow.

Rocket Red

Rocket Red and Orion headed to fight the Giant Snowman and The Spies and Jerry go back inside to watch more of the figure skating.

The Spies all put on their Laser Vision Contact Lenses and together with Superman they all melted the ice on Sergeant Rock. As the ice was melted Sargent Rock broke free and attacked Superman with his M50 Reising. Superman crashes into a pile of crates.

He then pointed his gun at Superman's face.

Sergeant Rock

Sergeant Rock

That look like G I Robot.

Clover

But witch one is the real G.I Robot?

Batman

Sergeant Rock fired his M50 Reising at the robot soldiers. The Girls keeping on firing off the robot soldiers and Superman uses his heat vision to melt the robot soldiers and Batman punched and kicked at the robots knocking their heads off. Suddenly more robots came into the warehouse.

Sam

Looks like more robots are coming into the warehouse.

Britney

How about some Laser Cannon Hair Dryer action.

Sam

Good idea

Britney pulls out her Laser Cannon Hair Dryer and fired it at the robots causing them to explode and fall to the floor. Suddenly all of the robots combined together into an even bigger robot.

Sergeant Rock

Ok that didn't happen in my day.

Blaine

With the advancements of technology we can use them for good or evil.

Superman

Well we have to take down that robot.

Alex

And you know the saying the bigger they are the harder they fall.

The Robot grabbed a giant crate and throw it on top of Sam Britney and Dean. Superman lifted the heavy crate off of them.

Superman

Are you alright?

Dean

Totally

Britney

Just a threw scratches and some rips from our spy suits but we're alright.

The Giant Robot then started to throw grenades at the Spies, Superman and Batman and Sergeant Rock, but they all dodged the explosion of the grenades, so the robot fired heat seeking missiles at them, the missile exploded on them on impact ripping parts from their suits and fall to the floor.

Sergeant Rock

Ok Heat Seeking missiles I don't have them in my day.

Clover

Well we have them now besides they totally reunited out suits.

Superman

But we still need to take him down.

Sargent Rock fired his machine gun at the robot

Sargent Rock

Superman

Stacy

Looks like G.I Robot is located.

Batman

And he is located in Mount Rushmore.

Alex

Hay we through it was creepy when we first tried it.

The Spies, Britney, Dean, Blaine, Superman, Batman and Sergeant Rock all teleported to Mount Rushmore. As they gotten to Mount Rushmore, Superman uses his X ray vision to hind a door that leads them into the Mount Rushmore WOOHP office.

Clover

So do you see the hidden door anywhere?

Superman

Yes it's right in front of us.

Alex

Mandy kicked Clover in the face knocking her out and getting Clover a bloody nose.

Moments later Sam, Clover, Alex, Blaine, Britney, Dean, Superman, Batman and Sargent Rock woke up and found themselves tied up and inside the Mount Rushmore WOOHP office.

Sergeant Rock

Where are we?

Blaine

It looks like we're in the WOOHP Mount Rushmore office.

Superman

But who is behind the robot clones of G.I Robot?

Clover

Well I think I saw Mandy during the knock out gas attack, she knocked use out and she gave me a bloody nose oh she is so going to pay.

Batman

Mandy isn't the one who made those robots.

Sam

You're right she doesn't have the genesis to make robot clones.

Alex

Witch Baddie do we know who made robots like these?

Suddenly Tim Scam and Mandy walked out of the shadows.

Dean

Tim Scam… looks like you're the genesis behind all of these G.I Robots.

Tim Scam

Yes I am and Mandy a robot genesis.

Mandy

Sergeant Rock

So you made those robot clones of G.I Robot… SO WHERE IS THE REAL ONE?

Tim Scam

Oh the Real one I made an upgrade to him.

Giant footsteps started to match out from the shadows and everyone saw a giant vision of G.I Robot.

Britney

Looks like Tim Scam puts some upgrades to G.I Robot.

Blaine

Alright Tim slip it what are you planning to do with all of these G.I Robots?

Batman

I know what he is up to… he is going to use these robots to attack all of the military bases in the world so he and the rest of the Legion of Doom have the upper hand in military technology and use these robots for their our prepress… after that is all over he is going attack every WOOHP office in the world and destroy the Justice League with these robots.

Tim Scam

That is right Dark Knight and I am going to use them to destroy you as well.

Batman uses his batarang to free him and the others. Sam, Clover, Alex, Blaine, Britney, Dean, Superman, Batman and Sargent Rock are free.

Superman

Not if we fight off your robots first.

Blaine

Alright girls.

Mandy

Mandy got off of Tim Scam and Tim Scam activated the Giant G.I. Robot. The Robot activated and fired lasers at Sargent Rock, but he dodged the fire of the laser.

Sergeant Rock

Sargent Rock leaded onto some boxes and then up to the balcony and attack Tim Scam.

Sergeant Rock

HOW DARE YOU TOOK CONTROL OF G.I. ROBOT?

Sargent Rock started to bet up Tim Scam, but Tim Scam stabbed him in the chest. Sergeant Rock stumbled backwards and Tim Scam punched him in the face.

Tim Scam
