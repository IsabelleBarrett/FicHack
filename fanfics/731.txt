I hate to do this to you but I have decided to put this story on hiatus. In the course of writing this story, I have taken on other endeavors that haven't permitted me to give this story the time and attention that it needs and as a result, I have decided to take it down until I am able to commit myself to it fully again. I thank those of you who have followed this story and stuck with me up until this point and hope that you will continue to do so during this hiatus. This is strictly a pause for me, not by any means a complete stop. I, and this story, WILL BE BACK :-)

Much love,
