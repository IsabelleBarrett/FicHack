The Winchester and The Werewolf.

I wake up to my alarm clock blaring, I hit the snooze button and roll over onto my back staring up at the ceiling trying to wake up fully. Todays my first day of sophomore year, it's also the first day seeing my best friends Scott and Stiles in a couple months. Over the summer I was hunting with my brothers Sam and Dean. My name is Azalea "Ace" Winchester. Im the youngest and the only girl, But im also one of the best supernatural haunter in the country. It's the family business, You see most people only hunt one specific thing. Werewolves, Vampires, Ghost', Ect But not us we hunt everything that bleeds and almost every thing that doesn't, Never anyone innocent We protect the Innocent only killing killers. I usually only hunt during the summer because i live with my uncle in Beacon hills, So i can go to school and live a "Normal life" umm news flash my life will never be normal it's in my blood. It's kind of a good thing though because me and my brothers don't get along too well they think im to unpredictable and thats saying something coming from dean Winchester the man is always ready to shoot something. I snap out of my thoughts feeling fully awake now, I roll out of bed and onto my dark purple carpet, my room is big and all jewel tones with lots of pillows on my canopy bed and and all my dressers and nights stands and my desk are all made with dark cherry wood so all and all my room is pretty dark but not in a gothic way more of a bollywood/ Moroccan sort of way i guess. I pull myself up and walk over to my closet throwing my black duffle bag of hunting equipment into the back before picking out a outfit. I decide on a pair of faded ripped skinny jeans, a white tank top with brown and gold beads along the deep scoop neckline and pair it with my worn out brown leather jacket and brown slouch boots. I curl my long black hair before putting on light make up just some black liner and mascara outlining my intense ice blue eyes and coating my full lips in watermelon flavored clear gloss before running down stairs grabbing an apple and yelling goodbye to my uncle and my cat trigger, before running out the door and jumping into my car. A black Mercedes convertible with red leather interior i setting into my seat and reach over to the clove box popping it open and pulling out my trusty dagger and sliding it into my boot thats one of my rules 'Always keep a blade in your boot'. On my way to school I stop to get a blue raspberry slushy like i do every morning i don't care if it's snowing i will have my slushy finally pulling into the parking lot i take the spot next to stiles' jeep and spot Scott chaining op his bike I start to make my way over there stopping to throw my cup away just in time to see jackson pull in and purposely hit Scott with his door i make my way next to Scott as jackson say's "Watch the paint job" i sigh we do this all the time because jackson is ...well jackson and i don't like jackson and jackson doen't like Scott. "Get over yourself jackson, it's not like you paid for it im still surprised you fit in there with you and your ego" i say with a smirk he just glares back "Why do you even hang out with losers like him anyway Zales?" Oh god i hate that nickname coming from him like eww "Because they're actual human being now run along" I say making a shooing motion with my hand. He's about to say something back but one of his friends calls him over thank god because jackson was about to get jack slapped thats right you better walk away- my inner rant was cut off by Scott hugging me "thanks ace" i hug him back "Aww your welcome scotty he's a douche anyway" i scoff making him laugh "Hey there's stiles" i follow is finger to see our hyperactive best friend waiting for us. I run over to him pulling Scott with me by the arm "STILES" i yell pulling him into a hug "ACE" he teases back making fun of my excitement before turning to scott "Ok lets see the thing" im so confused what are we looking at Scott pulls up his shirt revealing a large bandage on his side "OH. MY. GOD...what happened!?" i yell they shush me before explaining "last nigh two joggers found half a body in the woods me and scott went to look for it i got caught and he got bit by something" aw shit. "What bit you?" i ask fearing the answer

"It was to dark to see but i think it was a wolf" anndd we're screwed oh god oh god oh god this is not good "A wolf bit you? no not a chance" Scott looks confused "I heard a wolf howling" oh god this is SO not good. alright. ace get ahold of yourself your a Winchester you don't freak out. pull. yourself. together. after calming down from my slight freak out i tune back into they're conversation "How do you know what i heard" Scott scoffs "Because we don't have wolves in California not in like sixty years" "Really? Ace what do you think?" they turn to look at me i hesitate before saying "I..dont know it could be a wolf they have memories" "Oh my god they're are no wolves in California " stiles sighs "Fine but if you don't believe me about the wolf then your definitely not gonna believe me when i tell you i...found the body" I gape at him while stiles spazes out "are you kidding me?" "i wish im gonna have nightmares for a month" he shivers "Aw man up Scott it was just a dead body ...or half of one" i say jokingly "Oh man this is seriously the best thing to happen to this town since...since the birth of lydia martin" stiles says getting distracted by the beautiful strawberry blonde now strutting past us like she owns the place you gotta love lydia "You look like...like your gonna ignore me " he trails off "Again" i finish for him poor guys had a crush on the queen bee since like third grade and she's dating jackass i mean Jackson , no...wait. yup i mean jackass. "Your the cause of this you know" stile complains to Scott " dragging me down to your nerd depts. im a nerd my association im scarlet nerded by you" Scott looks at me with raised eye brows "Hey" i laugh crossing my arms over my chest and cocking my hip out "don't look at me lydia likes me she tolled me so she said and i quote ' i like you. your sassy in a i'd rip your head off kind of way and your fashion sense is killer'" i finish my lydia impression with a perfect hair toss "But hey if the nerd shoe fits wear it Cinderella" i sass throwing my arm around stiles and sharing a smirk with Scott stile rolls his eyes and shrugs my arm off as the bell rings "Come on princess" Scott says causing stiles to groan and me to laugh. we head of to the first period of the day English. oh the joy. note the sarcasm.

In English im alone with my thoughts and i start to worry about Scotts bite i'll have to keep an eye on him and hope for the best but at the moment it doesn't seem like it could get worst. Just then the principle walks in with a pretty brunette "Class this is our new student Alison argent" i drop my head on my desk . it just got worst.

Argent. Of course we just had to have the new student be part of a family of werewolf hunting wack jobs .

Finally the dreaded first day is over and i didn't lose my temper once and Scott hasn't killed anyone so i'd say it's a win after grabbing my bag from my locker i make my way to the lacrosse field to watch my boys tryout or sit on the bench like they always do I hear someone call my name and turn to see lydia waving me over with alison "Hey" i greeted the two wheni made my way over the them before taking a seat on the other side of lydia "Hey Zales" lydia greets back happily "This is Alison she's new, Alison this is my best friend Azalea or Zales or Ace for short" i smile at Alison before hugging lydia she thinks of me as her best friend aww i like her even more now "So Zales are you coming to my party on friday?" Lydia asks me twirling a piece of perfect strawberry blonde hair around her finger "Umm i don't know i'll have to see" i Reply i need to keep en eye on scott fridays the full moon she nods at my maybe and focuses back on the field i look toward the bench to try and see my boys. Wait just a darn minute Scott...is on the field Scott Mccall is on the field! That...That is new and he's heading to the goal? thats bad . oh boy. I heard Alison ask "Who's that" turning toward her i notice she's talking about scott aww she likes scott he could finally get a girl friend and she just had to be an argen? it wouldn't be so bad if half the family wasn't totally psychotic but shes sweet who know maybe she could be the good egg of the argent family. Lydia answered "Him?...im not sure who that is" i roll my eyes oh come on they've always gone to the same school i smile at Alison "Thats Scott Mccall he's one of my best friends why?" i ask with a knowing look she blushes "He just gave me a pen is all" i smirk "MmmHmm" i look to see Scott with his head turned toward us and then i realize he can already hear us the bites working fast. The coach blew his whistle and Scott grabbed his head in pain and i sat a little closer to the edge of my seat cringing when the ball hit the side of his head knocking him down causing everyone to laugh including the coach me being me and not being able to keep my mouth shut got up and the bleachers and stared yelling "HEY COACH why don't you stop laughing and act like the professional you claim to be?!" he glared at me "SIT DOWN WINCHESTER!" I threw my hands up hollering "I'll sit you down!" Lydia grabbed my arms and pulled me down glancing at Alison who had a shocked but amused look on her face "You ..get use to Azalea" she explained rolling her eyes fondly the next player throw a ball annd Scott caught it? Scott caught it! i jumped up screaming "Take that bitched Whooo!" everyone stared at me i rolled my eyes before sassing "Is there something wrong with your eyes? because umm they're not moving. and if you would like to keep them in your head i suggest they do" they all look away knowing im violent i smirk tossing my hair and taking my seat back.

We were all clapping for scott he was doing great! nothing can stop him now! oh. wait. jackson. The look on his face could kill my cat, He pushed everyone out of the way before running at scott and throwing the ball as hard as he could andd...Scott caught it! everyone was cheering for him now even lydia.

"I cannot believe you lost your inhaler in the woods" i complain jumping over some rock the boys just roll they're eyes at me , Well then. I jump onto scott back as we walk across a stream. What? these boots are not water proof plus its not like he cares anyway "You were amazing out there today scott" stiles says "Did you see the look on jacksons face?" i ask laughing "Oh god i should've taken a picture" "I dont know waht it was it's like i had all the time in the world to catch the ball" he explains "Thats not the only weird thing ether i can hear things i shouldn't be able to smell things!" hold on Scott its gonna get a whole lot weirder "smell things? like what?" stiles asks "Like the mint mojito gum in your pocket" he said looking at stiles "I dont have any-" he stoped short pulling out a piece of gum "Thank you!" i say hopping of Scotts back and grabbing the gum shooting him a smile as i pop it in my mouth "Or.. the watermelon lip gloss ace is wearing" he said looking at me i smile cheekily at him "It's my favorite" i say playfully blowing him kiss "So, All this started with a bite?" stiles asks with raised eye brows Scott looks back with wide eyes "What if it's like an infection like my bodies flooding with adrenaline before i go into shock or something?" "You know i think i'v heared of this before it's a specific kind of infection" stiles said seriously we all stop "Really" i ask already knowing whats really going on with scott "Yeah, yeah i think its called...lycanthropy" i almost chock on my gum shocked that stiles figured it out even if he's only joking "What is it is it bad?" Scott asks clueless as usual "It's the worst but only once a month" "Once a month?" Scott asks seriously confused this is gonna be so hard when friday rolls around "MmmHmm on the nigh of the full moon" stiles says before howling Scott glared at him and i elbowed him in the arm "There could be something seriously wrong with me" Scott says worried "I know your a werewolf Grrr" stile jokes. oh stiles you dont know how right you are "Ok obviously im joking but if you see me in shop class melting down all the silver i can find its because fridays the full moon" Scott rolls his eyes before stopping suddenly "I could've sworn this was it the deer came running i dropped my inhaler say the body and them got bit" "Maybe the killer moved the body" stiles suggested sounding way to excited about it "If he did i hope they left my inhaler those things are like eighty bucks" I roll my eyes well we'll never know if you don't shut up and look for it " i snap getting frustrated

After a few minutes of looking i was crouched down looking through a pile of leaves when i felt a presents behind me I look up at Scott and Stile to find them staring behind me wide eyed "Zales..." Stiles said I slowly slip my hand into my boot and grab my dagger then in one fluid movement i turn and hurl the dagger behind me .

Scott and Stiles stare at me shocked as i look at the stranger my dagger is stuck in a tree and few inches from his head and he didn't even flinch. werewolf. I look him over he's tall and built you can tell even through his t-shirt and leather jacked i trail my eyes up to his face he had short hair the same raven color as mine a strong jaw and intense light green eyes that we're glaring at me i simply shrug my shoulders mumbling a "Oopps" as i walk past him to get my dagger "What are you doing here this is privet property" he Asks "Sorry we Didn't know" stiles says "Yeah" i say pulling my knife from the tree bark "You should really put up a sign or something" i rant walking back over to stand by stiles "Is that always there?" stiles asks as i slip the blade back into my boot never breaking eye contact with the werewolf . "Yup" i reply popping the 'P' "We Were just looking for something...but forget it" Scott stutters out the man takes something out of his pocket before tossing it to Scott who catches it with ease looking down to see his inhaler i glance back at the wolf as the boys are distracted to find him walking away i mumble a "Thanks wolfie" under my breath knowing he can hear me his head snaps back narrowing his eyes at me i simply snap my gum and wink at him before turning back to my boys "Dude that was derek hale you remember don't you?" he asks i do his family they hale house fire it was big in the hunter community but i had never met one of them the hales were well respected and innocent it was tragic "remember what?" Scott asks "His family" i say "thay were all burn to death like six years ago" "I wonder what he's doing back?' Scott mumbles i sure don't know but im gonna find out. Stiles Scoffs before walking away leaving me running after them yelling "Wait some ones gonna carry me!"

I was in my room later that night laying upside down with my cat throwing daggers at a target that hung on my wall then there was a knock on my door "Come in" i call out the opens and in walks my uncle mason hes tall and tan like me but he has blonde hair and big hazel eyes he's never hunted himself seeing as he's my moms brother but he knows about us "Werewolves" he says seeing the silver daggers i was using "Scott was bit" i say walking over to my wall pulling out the daggers "What?!" he asks shocked "how many are there?" i sigh "Im not sure but i know theres at least one other beta but i havent seen the alpha yet" i explain he looks at me deep in thought and says "Maybe...we should call your brothers" i scoff "yeah right we don't get along plus i'v been doing this since i could walk, could shoot a desert eagle when i was nine and i never miss i'll be fine" "I know" he says reluctantly "But your brothers would be homicidal if something happened to you...just be carefull" he sighs before leaving my room my phone beeps i look down to see a text from scott that he's taking alison to the party "it's not me im worried about" i mutter to myself before taking a deep breath and hurling the dagger at the board hitting the bulls eyes dead on

As i walk with scott to the lacrosse field with scott im cracking up laughing "You landed in a pool?" i gasp out still laughing "Hey i slept walked like ten miles into the woods i thought it was a pool" he says with a chuckle "Oh god thats classic" the whistle blows and i run over to the bleachers to watch when i see stiles trying to talk to scott whos walking away as stiles throws his hands up franticly i go ask stiles whats wrong and he tells me about the wolf hairs "Did you tell Scott" i ask with a frown "I tried to he wouldn't listen what do we do now?" he panics "We make him listen" i say with a smirk before walking away

Scott makes first line i knew he would. I am currently walking into stiles' house, he asks Scott and I to meet him here. As i walk to the door way of stiles room i can hear him and scott talking already.

"I'v been up all night researching!"

"What are you talking about?"

"The wolf the bite in the woods remember the joke from the other day? not a joke anymore" Stiles sighs "Do you even know why a wolf howls?"

I Figure now would be a good time to make myself none "To signal the pack" I say walking into the room. "how'd you know that?" Stiles asks him and scott just now noticing me, I shrug me shoulders "I'm a Winchester" i say simply stiles just goes back to ranting, "So if you heard a wolf howling there could have been more maybe even a whole pack of them" "Wolves?" Scott asks clearly confused "No Werewolves." I state "Are you seriously wasting my time with this?" he yells "You know i picking up allison in an hour" "I saw you on the field today scott the way you move your speed your reflexes people can't suddenly do that over night!" stiles says slightly frantic "So i made a good shot?" Scott says with an agitated sigh "No. you made an impossible shot" i corrected "And don't think we haven't noticed you don't need your inhaler anymore" "Ok!..just i can't think about this right now we'll talk tomorrow " Scott says "What? No! the full moons tonight don't you get it!" stiles yells "What are you trying to do? I just made first line i have a date with a girl i can't believe wants to go out with me and everything in my life is suddenly perfect why are you trying to ruin it!?" Stiles sighs "I'm trying to help" I nod "Your cursed Scott" i sate blankly

"And not only will the moon cause the physical change it also happens to be when your blood lust will be at it's peak" Stiles continued "Bloodlust?" Scott asks clearly not impressed "Your urge to kill." i deadpan "Im already starting to feel the urge to kill Azalea" he says glaring at me. Oh hell no now im mad like seriously we're just trying to help i stand up to my full height yelling "Don't you threaten me! i will bleed you out buddy!" "Just listen!" stiles interrupted "The change can be caused by anger or anything that raises your pulse ok? i havn't seen anyone raise your pulse like allison does you gotta canceled that date" stiles says as he goes to look through Scotts bag "What are you doing?" he asks watching stiles pull out his phone "Im texting allison" he says like it was obvious "No! give it to me!" Scott yelling pushing stiles into the wall fist raised to hit him. I react quickly on instinct grabbing his arm holding it up by his shoulders and pushing inbetween his shoulder blades until he cries out in pain and knocks the desk chair out of the way instead he looks back at us wide-eyed "Im sorry.." he mumbles out grabbing his back and walking toward the door "I gotta go get ready for that date...sorry" he calls back one more time before leaving "Are you ok?" i ask stiles just walks over to his desk chair picking it up off the floor beofre freezing "Umm zale you might wanna see this.." i look over his shoulder to see three claw marks on the back of the chair "Awww shit."

Stiles some how convinced me to ride with him to lydia's party so we can keep an eye out for scott stiles followed me into my house so i could get ready real quick "So...uh how'd you know all that stuff and how to keep scott from hurting me ?" stiles asks "I..come from a long line of supernatural hunters" i explain as i walk out of the bathroon looking brutal in ripped black skinny jeans combat boots a corset and my black leather jacket "Supernatural hunters?" he questions warily "Some of the best in the country " i say with a smirk "what do you think i do all summer with my brothers" "You hunt." he says with a sigh i smile at him grabbing my duffle bag from the closet and setting it on the bed next to him "whats...Holy god!" he spazzes out as i open it to reveal all my weapons. I quickly suit up slipping my Chinese ring dagger in my boot to silver throwing knives into my corset "what are those?" he aks as i take out a set of something that looks somewhat like silver chop sticks i hit a button on the side and they extend into skinny silver stakes i pop them back into place before using them to hold my hair in a bun "can those kill him?" he questions with wide eyes. "Yes and no. they could kill him or just hurt him depending on how you use them but im not gonna do either this is just incase of other werewolves or hunters" I explain "wait.. theres other hunters?" I hesitate for a second "Yeah specifically werewolf hunters that would hurt scott..but i wont let em" I finish looking around before letting out a sigh and smiling a devious smile at stiles "Lets party!"

When we show up the party is in full swing we head to the back yard deciding to split up and look for scott i let out a breath when i see him dancing with allison and almost gag when a drunken greenburg stumbles up to me offering me a drink to that i simply take his drink from him and hand him a water bottle and replying with a sweet "I dont drink" and sending him on his way tossing out his cup before getting dragged up to the stage with a tipsy lydia she grabs the mike before giggling out "Heeeyy! this is my bestie ZayZay and i want her to sing a song KARAOKE!" I crack up laughing before taking the mike from her "As you all can see lyds a little tipsy at the moment because she just called me ZayZay...but if you guys wanna start doing karaoke then i guess i'll start it off" i tell the dj what song i wanna sing be for grinning at lydia everytime we have a sleepover which is not vary often but still we always do karaoke. The song starts and stiles lets out a loud whistle and i shot him a thumbs up before singing

By the time the song ends I hear stiles yelling for scott and im off the stage and out side in seconds to find allison standing outside watching scott drive down the street stiles following. really. really stiles. hopeless adderal junkie. i turn to allison asking what happened "I don't know" she said looking like she was about to cry. i really don't want her crying on me im not good with tears even my own. i just don't do tears "we were just dancing and i thought he was gonna kiss me and then he just ran off, did i do something wrong?" ohhh boy. scott is SO gonna owe me for this. I put on my best reassuring smile "No you didn't do anthing. ohh you know what? Scott has really bad asthma he probably wasn't feeling well and forgot his inhaler" She nodded looking better now "Allison, Azalea" we turn to see none other then derek hale i smirk at him knowing what game he's playing at already "I'm a friend of Scotts" Mmmhhmm im sure you are Allison turns to look at me seeing the look derek was shooting my way i decided to humor him "Of course hey derek" I say with my best smile allison seemed to relax after that "Do you need a ride?" he asks flashing us a killer smiles, figuring he was going to look for scott i was quick to accept "Yeah that would be great right allison?" "Um yeah thank you"

The ride was painfully awkward only talking when allison gave derek directions to her house when we pull up she politely thanks him for the ride before heading up the drive way "Allison" i call making her stop and turn around "You should give scott a second chance he really likes you and he's a great guy" I say making her blush she nods saying a quiet thank you and continuing into the house "Okay" i sigh turning to derek "lets go find Scott"

"How do you even know about any of this?" He asks cutting straight to the point. I hesitate for a minute "Im..A Winchester I was born into this" I explain watching Derek closely as his body tenses and his grip turns white knuckled on the steering wheel I keep talking not letting him say anything

"I've never hurt an innocent and i dont want scott to either. He didn't ask for this and hes gonna need help..he's one of my best friends he's always been there for me and im gonna be there for him." "even with the argents in town" he spits out bitterly. I scoff "Please half the argent family are loony toons" smiling when i see the corner of his mouth turn up ever so slightly.

The of the ride is silent when we pull up to the reserve we both exit his car walking to a clearing about a mile in "Now we just have to get him here"

"I got this." I state simply Pulling out a dagger from my corset, I can feel derek watching me intensely as i dont flinch my breath doesn't hitch my heart doesn't even skip a beat as i drag the dagger across my palm knowing his blood lust will bring him here as i watch the blood drip down my fingers and onto the forest floor. A few seconds later we hear a growl and i smirk at derek as a vary wolf like scott comes into view i steel myself knowing i might have to hurt him if he gets out of hand "Where is she?" he growls out and i feel kinda offended knowing that he's talking about allison even though it was my blood he smelled but i don't let it bother me "Shes safe...from you" he replies before jumping on scott "Get away from me!" Scott yells "Shh! be quiet!" derek says glancing around and i can hear them too even without werewolf hearing. Hunters. "Too late" i state walking over to them "Their already here...Run!" me and derek take off only to turn back seconds later hearing scotts cry of pain we arrive to see scott pined to a tree an arrow in his arm i turn to derek with a dangerous smile on my face "You take scott i got the hunters" I've got adrenaline in my voice even i can hear but i dont care i was born a fighter and im almost flawless at it. When i get a slight nod from derek im off. I pull the stakes from my hair not caring that i can still feel scott and derek watching me i stick the stakes into the ground using them to hold me up and i swing my body around sweeping the first hunter off his feet his head hits the ground with a hard thump and hes out. I bite my tongue as my still bleeding palm throbs against the cold silver but i dont let it stop me I throw myself into a front walkover taking the stakes with me as i go hurling them at the second hunter pining him to a tree as he cries out the third and last hunter chris argent turns around but by then derek has scott and we're gone. When we get far enough away scott sits against a tree trying to catch his breath "Who were they?" he pants out "Hunters" i state derek glances at me before walking over to scott "they've been hunting our kind for centuries" "you mean your kind you did this to me!" he's yelling now and im starting to get a headache from blood loss if the open wound and blood running down my arm has anything to do with it

"Is it really so bad scott that all your senses are heightened, your faster and stronger then humanly possible? the bite is a gift." I look up to see scott reaction, He. Is not. Happy. At All. "I dont want it!" "OK, alright. enough with the screaming and the yelling" i say wincing slightly as the wind hits my palm they look over at me before frowning at my hand derek places his hand on scott shoulder continuing the conversation a little quieter this time "You will. and your gonna need my help to control it so you and me scott, we're brothers now." And with that he turns to leave as he passes me i reach out and grab his arm causing him to stop and snap his head over to glare at me i give him a tired smile "Thanks." i say sincerely he frowns alittle before nodding and walking away as i release his arm "Well" i sigh looking over at scott "lets get going we've got a lot of walking and explaining to do."

When we finally reach the road the sun is coming up and i'v explained all about my family history to him he was shocked. mad. and them really tired as was i but i think hes ok with it now at least somewhat we both turn to look when we hear a car coming and breath out a sigh of relief when i see it's stiles.

"You know what worries me the most?" scott says "If you say allison im gonna punch you in the face" stiles says as we drive home "yeah? well im gonna punch you in the throat considering you were still thinking about her after i slit my hand open to find you" i huff out. Ok. so maybe it did get to me a little but i mean come on really?! "Oh my god" stiles breathes out looking back at me "theres a first aid kit under the seat back there" i smile a little at him to let him no im ok "thanks" i kind of block out the rest of the conversation to work on my hand first sticking it out the window and poring a bottle of water on it to see it better and now i wish i hadnt it's a lot deeper then i thought "Shit" i breath out causing stiles and scott to stop there conversation and look back at me "why'd you do that?" scott asks confused i roll my eyes "because you had blood lust i had a knife and we needed to find you do you followed the sent of my blood I just didnt think it went so deep" he looks guilty after that. i disinfect it before pulling out a needle and thread to give myself stitches. in a moving car. with my hyperactive best friend driving. fun. i pull a lighter out of my pocket sterilizing the needle before starting i dont show any signs of pain i didnt when i cut myself open and im not gonna when i stitch myself up "dont worry man" stiles starts we'll get through this even if i have to chain you up myself on the full moons and feed you live mice i had a boa once i could do it" I snort "your boa died after like two weeks and those things live for like ever" scott looks over at him with wide eyes as he says "yeah. well. i hated my boa" Before we all burst out laughing . This is my life now.
