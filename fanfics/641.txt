Chará: Is it candy?



GodofGreed: No.



Analytē: Is it a new gift?



?: Not for you.



Percy: Is it a new monster?



?: Stop guessing!



GodofGreed: We have someone new joining the chat.



Percy: I know you like to include your OCs, but it better not be Mark!



?: If it was Mark, I'd leave the chat.



Analytē: Can we bring Mark here just for one chapter?



?: You-



GodofGreed: Enough. It's not Mark, it's Black Power Ranger.



Chará: How'd he get in?



GodofGreed: He passed every difficult trial I threw at him. He climbed mountains, he wrestled gorillas, he-



?: He payed to get in.



GodofGreed: That was a big part of it. So let's hear from the newest addition to our chat, Black Power Ranger!



Black Power Ranger: GodofGreed, you forgot to say that I had to punch Mark in the face. Also don't forget about the little surprise we planned for the readers.



GodofGreed: True, true. My bad. Should we tease the readers?



Black Power Ranger: Yes we should. Ohh a fighter jet.



GodofGreed: Sweet!



?: Wait! What do you have planned? Why was I not included?



Chará: You don't know?



Analytē: GodofGreed showed you the page where they discussed it.



Percy: Where you daydreaming?



?: I plead the fifth! And if you don't like that, if you leave me be, I'll throw Mark into a room of Mark-haters!



Black Power Ranger: Fine. Here is the plan.*whispers in ?'s ear.* I have a fighter jet. Look out, Mark. Oh Analytē, can I borrow your hunters? I need to hunt someone down. GodofGreed knows who it is.



?: *grins like Asura* Nice.



GodofGreed: *smirks*



Analytē: Sure, but we can't use too many details, GodofGreed wants to pull out all of the stops at once with the hunters.



Black Power Ranger:*smirks evilly* Don't worry. It will be quick. Now onto the story!



?: *gasp* You stole GodofGreed's line!



GodofGreed: I don't mind.



?: Why not?



GodofGreed: He paid.



?: ...Just start the story.



GodofGreed: You don't get to say that.



Black Power Ranger: Ha! I get to say his line but you can't. Take that ?.



?: I'm going to go bother someone now.



GodofGreed: Come back before they form an angry mob and decide to rid the world of you, or after, I don't really care.



?: Wait. What?



GodofGreed: I mean...come back before it gets dark.



Black Power Ranger: GodofGreed! Don't tell him of our other plan.



GodofGreed: Don't worry, I won't.



Chará: *whispers* We have another plan?



Analytē: *shrugs*



Percy: Now that ? is freaking out, maybe we should start the story.



Black Power Ranger:*whispers the other plan to Chará and Analytē.*Percy is right.



GodofGreed: I say when we start the story, or Black Power Ranger can say it. I say we start it. One more thing, the last chapter was an extra, it didn't really happen in this story. No one fell into the digital sea yet.



Black Power Ranger: I agree with GodofGreed.

When Eric awoke, he realized that he didn't imagine meeting Percy.

He also realized something else.

He was in pain.

Horrible agony.

Eric screamed as power and knowledge that before he wouldn't have believed existed flowed through his mind and body.

Percy spoke in his odd voice, "
It's almost over. Just remember that when it is over, you will have the power to free yourself and everyone else here from slavery. For mortals like yourself, true freedom can only be found through me. I have no interest in ruining lives, I want to build a better world. Join me, stand by my side, and I will reward you beyond your wildest dreams!
"

Eric somehow managed to nod despite the pain he was in.

The next burst of power caused Eric to scream so loud, the people on the floors right above and right below him could hear him.

The two guards that were standing outside of the room where Eric was tortured by their superior were getting nervous, jumpy, and scared.

The first guard asked, "Sh-should we check on the kid?"

The second guard answered, "N-no. Popernok told us to stand guard here." (
AN: I've given the name 'Popernok to the torturer, I'm getting tired of writing 'the torturer' or 'their superior'.
)

"But won't Popernok be pissed if he's dead when he comes back?"

"D-do you want to go in there? If so, count me out!"

"I-I don't, but you know what Popernok does when he's unhappy. I'll take my chances with a screaming brat over a pissed off torture expert any day."

Suddenly, the screaming stopped.

The two guards looked at each other, their fear was obvious.

The first guard gulped as his shaking hand opened the door.

When he opened the door, a fist met his face.

The first guard was knocked into the wall. The second guard jumped in shock before readying his gun.

The attacker stepped out of the room, his appearance shocked the second guard.

Standing at 7 feet tall, carrying a sword in one hand, a bow on its back, wearing black armor with a symbol that looks like a mix between a target and an eye on the chest, a black helmet with the same symbol on it.

The second guard raised his gun, the Monster Guard ripped it out of his hand, and punched him in the face.

After the second guard passed out, another Monster Guard came out of the room. The two Monster Guards looked at each other for a second before they each slung an unconscious guard over their shoulders and left to hide the unconscious bodies.

Popernok returned with his tools a few minutes later.

The first thing he noticed was the fact that the guards were gone.

Popernok scowled as he entered the room, grumbling about no good guards.

When he saw Eric just as he left him, hands chained behind a metal pole behind his back, he gave a sigh of relief, '
At least the brat didn't get out.
'

Popernok frowned for a second, '
Why is he looking down? He better still be alive.
'

Popernok chuckled sadistically, "Tell me something, brat. Did you miss the company? Right after this, you're going straight into solitary confinement!"

Eric chuckled, "Better than having to look at you."

Popernok snapped, "You annoying little-! That's it! When I'm done with you, you're going to beg for something as mild as pain!

Popernok walked over to the wall and pulled a switch, causing electricity to surge through the metal pole.

When Eric didn't scream in pain, Popernok was shocked. His surprise grew when Eric chuckled, "While you were out, I spoke to someone. He told me why we're building this tower, he told me your organization's plans, he gave me power, and, most importantly, he gave me freedom."

With the last word, Eric broke the chains that were holding his hands behind his back broke as he pulled them apart.

Eric rubbed his wrists, "You guys are hypocrites, did you know that? You're so against technology and electricity, but you're willing to use them just to make sure no one else can. I think you need a taste of your own medicine."

With one hand, Eric grabbed the pole that was still conducting electricity, and he pointed the other one in Popernok's direction.

The next moment, Popernok screamed as electricity coursed through him.

Less than a minute later, the electric surge stopped and Popernok fell down.

Popernok moaned, "Why…why did you stop?"

Eric looked down at him, "Believe me, it's not because I've developed Stockholm syndrome. It's because my new master is a benevolent god and he wants as little deaths, if any at all, as possible. Besides, you have a place in his plan.

Popernok's vision went dark, the last thing he saw was a grinning Eric.

Outside the tower, everyone stopped working as they saw an explosion from inside of the tower.

The guards started questioning each other and the workers.

Suddenly, the front door to the tower was knocked down. On the other side was a Monster Guard with a glowing eye of XANA on its face.

Meanwhile, back at camp half-blood.

Annabeth was standing in the scanner waiting to be virtualized.

Annabeth held her breath as she prayed to all of the gods and goddesses that everything would go perfectly.

As the scanner started to light up, she took in a deep breath, and opened her eyes just in time to see the real world vanish.

Extra




Mark was walking in the forest.

Mark kicked a rock while grumbling, "Stupid Percy, getting possessed. Why should we help someone who's stupid enough to get possessed so easily? I wouldn't be possessed so easily. He fought Kronos, didn't he? He should be able to fight some weak computer program."

Mark then heard some bushes rustle.

Mark sighed, "This better be my fans. I'm not in the mood to fight."

Mark then heard a voice, "Turn around…over here…"

Mark called out, "Hello? Who's there?"

The voice replied, "Over here…"

Mark walked over to where he heard the voice, "Who's there? I swear if this is a prank-"

The voice whispered one word in Mark's ear, "Run…"

Mark's head shot in the direction he heard the voice, and he saw…

…Absolutely nothing.

Mark said to himself, "Heh, guess it was just my-"

Mark was cut off by a hissing sound.

Mark repositioned his head back to where it was before the voice whispered in his ear.
Mark could see a long, pitch-black head with a mouth, but no eyes.

The creature had sharp teeth and was drooling. The creature opened its mouth and roared.

Mark ran away screaming.

Annabeth and Thalia were talking near the forest.

"It's all my fault!"

"No it's not, it's that idiot Mark's fault."

"I was the one who cheated on Percy!"

"Mark drugged you."

"I'm a daughter of Athena, I should know better!"

"We all make mistakes. Tell you what, the next time I see Mark, I'll make him piss his pants."

The topic of their conversation just ran out of the forest, twigs covering his hair and screaming, "Monster! There's a monster in the forest!"

Annabeth rolled her eyes, "Yes Mark, we put monsters in the forest, no need to shout it.

Thalia burst out laughing.

When Annabeth looked at her questioningly, Thalia pointed to Mark's pants.

Mark blushed as the girls continued to laugh at him.

GodofGreed: I hoped you enjoyed the chapter, despite the lack of demigods.



?: I can't wait for the next chapter! *bangs on keyboard* Start writing!



GodofGreed: ...I'm going to have to delete a lot of gibberish, aren't I?



Analytē: Yeah...



Black Power Ranger: I am scared. GodofGreed, hold me. Percy, I hope you like what I did to Mark.



Percy: I like the idea, yes.



GodofGreed: That reminds me, the extra was inspired by Black Power Ranger.



Analytē: I hope we get reviews asking for me or Chará.



Chará: Me too!



Black Power Ranger: Chará do you want a cookie? Also Percy, GodofGreed and I have a gift for you but you can't get for another few chapters.



Chará: Cookie! Cookie!



Analytē: Why would you offer him that?



?: Don't you remember what happened last time?



Percy: You guys are the best. Thank you.



GodofGreed: It was no problem at all, thank Black Power Ranger.



Black Power Ranger: You're welcome Percy. And yes I do, that's why I offered him a cookie and besides he wasn't in the chapter so I felt bad for him.



Chará: You are amazing, Black Power Ranger!



Analytē: *sigh*



GodofGreed: Thank you, my wonderful readers, and a special thanks to you Black Power Ranger!
