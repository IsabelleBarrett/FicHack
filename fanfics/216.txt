Hi losers it's me, Gary Muthafuckin Oak, and this will be a collection of stories accounting my legendary achievements as a Pokemon Trainer, Pokemon Researcher, Pokemon breeder, ass-kicker, and all around Swag Master. So you better be greatful that I'm taking the time to tell the legend that is my daily life. Also don't bother with pairings anymore, cuz we all know that all the ladies fall for the Oak-man's swag. Well that's it for the prologue, smell you later...losers!
