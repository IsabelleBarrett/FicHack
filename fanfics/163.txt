We were walking through the sewers, when we heard someone walking, splashing in the puddles coming closer. As we hid I saw that the boy had a black dog with him. CRASH! A canister of mutagen fell through the grates, breaking into a million pieces. The ooze covering the glass shards, the dog walked closer to it, sniffing and she dove into it.

We watched in horror, as the whining turned into screaming, then a gasp.

Unknown POV

I looked at the world, in a new way. The burning sensation was all over my body, especially my eyes. I looked up to see my master, my only friend scream and run.
"Master!?" only it came out as crying!
I looked around and saw four giant turtles.

The tallest one, had a gap tooth and they were all staring at me in amazment. There was one that caught my eyes, he had a crack in his shell, and a locked eyes with his emerald green ones. I tried to say something, but failed. I smiled in delightment as this turtle picked me up, and took me to where they were heading.

Raphael's POV

I saw the little dog mutant smile at me as I picked her up, I noticed a change in her eyes right away. They were brown when she was a dog, when she got mutated they turned... emerald green. Then I noticed, unlike Dog Pound, her skin had turned black. She had dog ears on the top of her head and she had a nice little tail. She had black ( long) hair which matched her tail and skin.

As we sat down on the couch her little body curled up into a ball against my plastron.

" I got her Raphael." Master Splinter said

" Na, it's ok..." I started when I noticed everybody was staring at me

" What?" I looked around. Mikey was staring at me in shock.


What did I say?
I remembered that I had never cared for anything like this except for Slash, I mean Spike.


I might actually love this little girl.
My eyes widened in shock.
Oh shell...
