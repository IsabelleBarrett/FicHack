Drunken Grayfia Part 1


'
Damn… Damn… Damn it!'
Was the thought going through Natsu mind as he ran through the empty halls of Gremory Mansion
naked,
with a panic look on his face. Now some of you may be wondering, why is Natsu running in the halls with a panic look on his face? Well let's have a flash back twenty minutes ago and witness the very event.


Flashback 20 minutes ago~



It was a normal day in the Gremory mansion, or so its seem normal. Now the flashback take place inside of Lord Gremory office room. Where you will find Natsu, Lord Gremory and Sirzech having a drinking contest with Happy sitting on a couch eating his raw fish.


"
Man this is what you call a drinking contest! I bet Cana will be jealous of all this booze HAHAHA" Natsu laugh while chugging another sake as a butler came and refill his mug.


"
Hahaha, I don't know who's this Cana person is, but I bet she be mad right now Hahaha!" Sirzech laugh patting Natsu on the back causing the former pink hair mage to choke on his drink.


"
Aye, she be super mad!" Happy perks up after finishing his fish as another butler brought him another fish for his enjoyment.


"
Happy~ your so furry and blue~ yet your living here in the Underworld you have angel's wings! How come man~" Lord Gremory asks in his drunken state, Happy brought out his wings and float in front of Lord Gremory.


"
Aye because I'm an Exceed!" Happy replied


"
Oh~ an Exceed huh?" Lord Gremory nod his head until he pauses and look at Happy. "What's an Exceed?"



Happy was about to answer, but a loud crash was heard next to them. Turning their gaze to the source of the crash, they saw Sirzech and Natsu holding each other by the front of their shirt with their fists cock back.


"
You bastard that hurt you know." Natsu said tighten his hold on Sirzech shirt.


"
I said I was sorry, don't cry over it!" Sirzech replied, they both tried to swing at each other. Since they were drunk both their fist misses their target, which was the face.


"
You bastard how did you dodge my punch?" Natsu asks, Sirzech was about to reply but the door to the room open and everyone saw Grayfia walks in with her maid uniform and her usually stoic expression.


"
Fia-chan, I miss you!" Natsu cries out, shoving Sirzech onto the coach and ran up to Grayfia to give her a big hug. Well that was the plan anyway, while closing in on Grayfia, Natsu found his cheek being pinch. "Ow, ow stwop ish, my chewek." He whimpers out.


"
Please behave yourself Natsu-sama." Grayfia simply reply, letting go of Natsu cheek.


"
Why do you always add –sama every time we're not alone?" Natsu ask, nursing his swollen cheek.


"
Because I'm working."


"
Oh, right"


"
Oh Grayfia, what bring you here?" Sirzech said getting up from the couch and made his way towards the couple.


"
Lady Gremory asks me to remind you and Lord Gremory that you guys have a meeting to attended at 1 today." Grayfia inform.


"
Aw crap, your right." Sirzech mutter, "Mah, let's not worry about little stuff right Nat-Argh" Sirzech didn't get to finish his sentence as he got his cheek pinch by Grayfia who was giving him a look.


"
Sirzech-sama, please refrain from being lazy, or I will inform your wife about you slacking on your responsibility." She threatens, making the new Lucifer pale at mentioning about his wife. They are only three people who bring fear to red Lucifer, one was his mother, as should all mother should bring fear to their children. The second is Grayfia, who's strict all the time and will punish him with force, and the last but not least his mystery wife on his family knows even Natsu since he's part of the family now.


"
Okay, I'll head to the meeting, please don't tell my wife." Sirzech plead, as Grayfia gave a small smirk. It's good to hold power over Sirzech.


"
Very well, I will not inform Lady Lucifer." Hearing this Sirzech brighten up and began making his way to his father, but along the way he patted Natsu on the back. But he accidentally put too much force on hand cause Natsu to stumble to Grayfia causing their lips to touch.



Upon seeing this everyone in the room eyes pops out. Why would everyone be shock when two couples are kissing? Well remember earlier, before Grayfia walk in, the men of Gremory household were holding a drinking contest…with alcohol. So let's do the math.



Drink contest with Alcohol + Natsu + kissing Grayfia =? Do you know what we get?


"
Uh, oi what's the big idea Sirzech…huh why are you guys pale? Who are you pointing at its only Grayfia behind me. Huh…. You want me to look behind me." Natsu turn around to look at Grayfia and his face lost all its color as he gazes upon Grayfia.



That's right the answer to our problem was a drunken Grayfia! Who has a pink tint on her cheek as her eyes are half lid while letting out small hiccup.


"
Ugh, Fia-chan are you oka-WHAM!" Natsu dropped like a sack of potato as Grayfia smack him on the head with a frying pan…hard. You ask where she got the frying pan from, well that's a mystery.



Letting out a small giggle, Grayfia began to speak. "hehe, sorry Natsu-kun but I'll deal with you later but first I got something to take care of first." She finishes as her eyes gaze at the remaining male in the room. With Sirzech, Lord Gremory, Happy and even the butlers huddle together in the corner cowering in fear.



Line Break~


"
Ugh… what hit me?" Natsu slowly return to the land of the living or should he say the dead, since he's in hell….



Get it, since dead people either go to heaven or hell….



*crickle*


…
tough crowed…



Any who, Natsu found himself tied down with anti-magic chain on each of his limbs. He also notices that he's currently naked, save for his boxers.


"
What the hell going on? Happy you out there little buddy?!" Natsu shouted, waiting to hear his best friend response but was no use. He was about to shout again but the door to the room open and a figure walk inside.



Taking a sniff of the person scent, Natsu face became pale as his face morphs into horror expression.



Standing in front of him was none other than a drunken Grayfia, but what made Natsu took white as the bed sheet was the outfit she was wearing. She was wearing a tight black leather suit that cover little of her body, and a whip in her hand.


"
H-hey there Fia-chan how you doing?" Natsu nervously asks, Grayfia made her way to Natsu with a tint of red plaster on her cheeks with her eyes half lidded.


"
I'm do-doing fine N-Natsu-sama.." Grayfia giggle as she stood in front of the bed where Natsu was being tied down. "Now, as for you…you'll be calling me One-sama for now on…." Natsu pale when she crawls on the bed towards him.


"
HELP!" HE cry out, but it fell in deaf ear.


"
kukuku, don't bother shouting, everyone in the mansion can't hear you." Grayfia began licking Natsu abs up to his chest, causing Natsu to shiver.


"
W-what did you do t-to them?"


"
Kukuku, let's just say they…...are unavailable at the moment…" Grayfia said, now came face to face with his face, before leaning down to his ears.


"Now, time to spread those butt cheeks!"


She whispers, with Natsu losing all the color in his body.


"
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"




To be continue…...(maybe)





Chapter End.
