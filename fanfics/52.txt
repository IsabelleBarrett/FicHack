On The Road



Prologue


A man stood by a large window, looking out onto large vast city that was bustling with daily morning routines. His room was dark, and the only light that illuminated the space was from that very window, until two men pushed the large double doors open and scurried inside.

"Tony sir, we've captured all the Pokémon you have requested." Tony turned around and in the light revealed a young looking man, with light brown hair and hazel eyes. He had a slightly built figure, and was wearing a skinny suit combining the colours of black and purple.

"And where actually have you placed all my Pokémon?" He questioned, cocking an eyebrow.

"In the inner sanctum sir." One stammered. He was a younger boy with messy black hair, and his uniform hung loosely on his skinny body. "We must relocate soon though, the trainers will contact Officer Jenny soon enough. They'll find us here."

"Enough." The boy zipped his mouth and stepped back beside the other boy that came with him to deliver the message. Tony paced around the room, deep in thought. "Move out to the Saffron hideout. Gym Leader Sabrina is back from her trip and everything is on tight security after we had infiltrated Sliph Co. They'll least expect us to go back there. We'll leave at first light tomorrow."

"Rodger that sir." The two boys rushed out of the room as Tony slumped into his large office chair. His Ninetales trotted over and lay down beside him. Its beautiful red eyes pierced into Tony's as they seemed to share inner thoughts with each other.

"Yes Tiffany, we're moving again." He paused for a bit. "No, we can't even tell Stephanie about this. We can't bring her into this."
