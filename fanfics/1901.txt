Chapter One

Hello. My name is Alice, but I can't seem to find wonderland. This is the story of my life that took an abrupt ending when I was sixteen years old. I could never think clearly while I was alive. My body was lively in the cold, dark world most call home. Now that I'm six feet under; I see all of the events of my life clearly. I not only know my own thoughts, but the thoughts of others as well.

In short, I took my own life. My soul had vanished long before I died, due to a bombardment of hate and attack. No medication or therapy would work for me. The so called doctors and therapists I saw just said I was a special case. I don't blame them for my death, even though they were tried and imprisoned for a wicked case of malpractice. I blame society. I came into the world unaware of anything, then I left all knowing.

I was born and raised in the small town of Willow Park. There may have been ten thousand people there during my life, but I'm not sure. All I know is that the number of people was too damn many. When I was born, Willow Park was the happiest place for a family to live. Parks of large, majestic willow trees as far as the eye could see. The buildings were always well maintained. The bricks of the school were freshly mortared and the windows on the office building gleamed in the sun. Not a flake of paint peeled from the shutters of a single home, and the lawns were manicured as though no one had anything else to do with their time. Soon, people's souls were being robbed from them as they continued living in this putrid, alarmingly drug-ridden, hole-in-the-wall town. One of those souls was mine. In the end, everything and everyone collected dust, as everyone, so hooked on drugs, kept the mindset of a stereotypical thirteen year old street kid.
