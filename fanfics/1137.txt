
Title: My Favorite Rock Star's A What?
Part: Epilogue

Rogue had to hold up Kitty as they got off the plane. "Sit here." She said, forcing Kitty into a seat. "We'll get our stuff in a sec."

Kitty let out a groan. "I don't get it... I'm never sick on the Black Bird."

"Yeah... commercial planes don't have the technology we've got." Rogue laughed.

"Petite!" Someone tapped her on the shoulder. Rogue spun around. "Didn' know y'were on my plane."

He was about six feet tall, well built. Short dark brown hair framing his chiseled features. Glasses covering the eyes Rogue knew were not normal. From her dream, and from when he'd bumped into her.

He wore all black, a trench coat slung over his shoulder. "What brings y'to New York?"

"Ah live here."

"At de airport?"

Rogue faked a laugh. "Funny. What brings you here? Except of course, you runnin' from that girl."

"I'm seventeen years old, Petite. Don' wanna be married." He laughed. "'Sides, y'heard her yell. Dat'll only get worse wit' time."

Rogue laughed. "Her poor heart was broken. Why ask her ta marry you if you didn't want ta marry her?"

"My father arranged de marriage, if y'must know."

"So, where y'stayin'?"

"Actually, I'm jus' waitin'. Goin' t'Seattle."

"Too bad." She said. Hugging herself from the chill she'd got when he'd said Seattle. Her mind connected that with the dreams she'd had.

"Maybe I'll come visit you sometime, neh?" He asked.

Kitty was leaning into the seat Rogue had put her in. Her head down, but, she was watching everything Rogue did.

Talking with the boy from New Orleans. Kitty'd seen him on the plane and debated on whether she should tell Rogue or not. She'd, of course, opted not to.

Rogue looked like she was gonna be sick when she'd told Kitty she'd had a dream about him.

"Waiting for someone?" Pete asked, sitting down next to her.

"What are you doing here?"

"Someone had to pick the two of you up. I offered." He grinned. "It was a long week. Did you have fun?"

Kitty tugged at the ends of her hair nervously. "Uh... yeah. It was really nice there."

He took her hands in his, eyes downcast. Kitty looked at him nervously. "I'm glad you're back."

Kitty blushed. "So am I."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pete had been pulling Kitty along a small path for quite some time. They were still on the Institutions grounds, but they were so far from the mansion that Kitty started getting nervous.

"Where are going?" She asked.

"Thought you just wanted to walk?" He asked.

"Yeah. It's... just kind of getting late."

Pete shrugged and leaned against a tree. Kitty stood in front of him, biting her lip.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rogue sat up on the roof of the mansion, looking around. From up there, one could see everything. And, Rogue saw a bit more than she wanted to.

Pete and Kitty were near one of the walls, making out... the thought of "like teenagers" crossed her mind, but Pete wasn't a teenager.

Rogue looked away, turning her thoughts to Remy. She's given him the mansion's number. In case he was ever in town.

She hoped what she had seen wouldn't come true. She wondered if she should have told him. Or maybe the Professor.

But, everything had been so awful, she didn't want to imagine that it'd happen.

Another piece of wood crashed against the far wall of the run down theater. Exploding on contact, making a hole.

He thought of the beautiful girl, Rogue she said her name was, that he'd met. He would of stayed in New York just because of her.

But, he was a danger to others. If she knew what he was, she probably would of run. Been afraid of him for the fact that simply by touching her, he could kill her.

He wouldn't understand the irony of that for years, but, as it was, all he could do was toss things. Try to burn off his seemingly inexhaustible energy.

"Something wrong, my dear boy?" A voice called from the audience.

Remy peered into the dark, seeing a tall figure. "Who's dere?"

"My name is Nathaniel Essex. I believe I can help you with that problem of yours." He said, laughing sinisterly.

**Also, if you see the names "Trent", "Danny" or "Robin", please let me know so I can change 'em. I'm pretty sure I got everything, though. Thanks. :)
