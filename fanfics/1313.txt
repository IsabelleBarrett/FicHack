There's people who chew gum, and then there's the pros, like Ornshaw. O'Leary's useless, no staying power, and last time Stacey tried blowing a bubble, they all ended up pitching in to get it scraped off his glasses. Ornshaw can crack gum, blow bubbles, switch between two pieces, and hide it so even the school dentist can't find it. He's always up for a challenge, but there aren't many takers.

He's been working on this piece for three days, so he's more than slightly narked about it when Mr Dicks spots him halfway through the lesson and tells him to walk to the front of the class and spit it in the bin. Ornshaw's the creative type, though, and as Dicks happens to have turned round to write on the blackboard just as he arrives there, he has the feeling that there's got to be a better place to do it than that.

Dicks makes them read their homework translations out loud. Ornshaw hasn't done his. Dicks quotes him
non scholae sed vitae discimus
, which means something or other about education being for life and not just for school. Ornshaw asks if Mr Dicks can recommend them some Latin phrases for the match on Saturday.

"You have no sense of history in your soul, Ornshaw," Dicks says, when he's calmed down enough to speak, "which comes as no surprise to me, because I doubt that you're in possession of one." He fishes a white hanky from his trouser pocket and wipes his forehead, then picks up his tea from its precarious position on the edge of the desk just above the bin. Ornshaw looks up again just in time to see him drain half the cup in one long, slow mouthful.

And thinks what a bloody fantastic world it is.
