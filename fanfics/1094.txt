CAM661K 02:38PM. BERNARD and MANNY are sat in the cinema waiting for a film. ARNOLD comes in and sits down.

ARNOLD: Er, excuse me.

BERNARD turns to look at ARNOLD.

BERNARD: Yeah?

ARNOLD. There's no smoking on this side. You should be sitting over there.

BERNARD turns back to the screen.

BERNARD: Ah, don't worry about it. Go and get me a drink sometime.

ARNOLD: Look, put that out or move!

BERNARD turns back to face ARNOLD.

BERNARD: What for? Nobody's complaining.

ARNOLD: Yes they are, I am. So, would you kindly move back to the proper designated smoking area for the convenience of other patrons.

BERNARD blows a smoke ring at ARNOLD's face. ARNOLD coughs.

ARNOLD: Right. You're on report, me laddo.

ARNOLD whips out a notebook and pen and starts scribbling rapidly. BERNARD mimics this. After a few seconds, ARNOLD notices this.

ARNOLD: (testily) You are treading a very thin line, me laddo. I'm not going to stand here and be insulted.

BERNARD: (calm) Well, I didn't ask for the job of insulting you. You know, in another life, maybe we could have been brothers, running a small, quirky tavern in Sicily. Maybe we would have married the local twins instead of wasting each other's time here, in this dump. But it was not to be, so… hop it.

BERNARD turns back to the screen. ARNOLD gives him a nasty look and walks out.

MANNY: Bernard-

BERNARD: (testily) Don't start, people-lover.

CAM159K 02:45. MANNY is sitting at the control consoles in the DRIVE ROOM, drinking soup. EVAN comes in.

EVAN: Manny, a word.

MANNY turns around, stands up, and follows him out of the room.

CAM192L 02:46. MANNY enters EVAN's office.

EVAN: Sit down, Manny.

MANNY and EVAN sit down. EVAN looks distastefully at the soup pot.

EVAN: What's that you're drinking?

MANNY: It's soup. (pause 3s) It's extra chunky.

EVAN looks at the offending soup pot.

EVAN: What's in it?

MANNY: Chunks.

EVAN looks back to Manny.

MANNY: Do you want the McKintyre Accounts? I've got them on disc. I would have e-mailed them to you, but… there was a lot of… clink on the… stuffer… expander… and… plug went in some Tizer-

EVAN: I see!

MANNY jumps back in his seat.

EVAN: I took a risk with you, Manny. I took a risk when I gave you a job. A lot of people would have said "Who is this rudderless hippy? How do I get away from him? Has he got a hunting knife strapped to his shin?" But I saw through that. But you have to work for me, OK?

MANNY: OK. Thank you, Evan.

EVAN: (cheerily) OK.

MANNY gets up to leave.

CAM431R 03:11. BERNARD is sitting in the BUNKROOM talking to FRAN.

BERNARD: I'm not doing my exam.

FRAN: Why not?

BERNARD: (tetchy) Because you can stick it up your arse!

BERNARD flails his hands in the air to emphasize the point.

FRAN: Bernard, you'll just have to do it yourself. It's quite easy.

BERNARD sits up straight.

BERNARD: (muttering) Yeah, I'll give it… give it a go. I'm sure I could… could muddle along, actually.

CAM431R 03:16. BERNARD is sat at his desk staring at the exam.

BERNARD: (manic) WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN!? The WHAT!? What does the red spectrum tell us about… Quasars… WHAT?

CAM431R 03:17. BERNARD is slumped back in his seat, blowing his exam sheet into the air.

CAM431R 03:18. BERNARD is standing in front of a large pile of socks.

BERNARD: Right, that's all my socks paired. Back to the exam.

CAM431R 03:19. BERNARD is speaking over the phone.

BERNARD: Hello, Ma? It's Bernard. (pause) No, nothing's wrong. (pause.) Come on, I don't need an excuse to call my mother now, do I?

CAM431R 03:19 (11 seconds later). BERNARD is showing stress while talking on the phone.

BERNARD: I know, I am, yeah. I know. Yes. Yes. I will. Ha, yes. (angry) Yes! I know. Yeah. OK- (shouting) Goodbye, I have to do my test!

BERNARD slams the phone down.

CAM431R 03:27. BERNARD is leaning on the sink holding the examination paper, wearing sunglasses. FRAN dissolves onto the mirror screen.

BERNARD: Fran! Just pop some Fizzigood in the dispenser thingy.

FRAN: (confused) What?

BERNARD: Fizzigood. Y'know, Fizzigood make feel nice.

FRAN: Oh, Alka-seltzer.

A packet of tablets appears in the dispenser. BERNARD grabs it, opens the lid and necks the entire bottle. FRAN moves back from the screen in surprise.

FRAN: um… how was… how was your night?

BERNARD: Hmm? Oh, just my usual night out. Went to see an experimental film where nothing happened for two hours. Hung out with a Simulant, got a job at the Big Bang Burger Bar, you know, the usual.

FRAN: Ah. (cheery) So, finished with your exam?

BERNARD: Not yet. I'm turning it into a rather smart casual jacket.

FRAN: (mild irritation and humorous) Bernard! I mean, it's probably a very nice jacket, but what are you going to do about the exam?

BERNARD: I don't know! Will you do them?

FRAN: (concentrating) Oh well, look, you've got that wrong for a start, 'cause you divide by ten there- (indignation) oh, no, no, no, I'm not doing this. I have to give all my attention to minding the onboard repairs. There's a faulty Drive Plate in White Corridor 159 that needs fixing.

BERNARD: What's this now – blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-yah-yah-blah-blah… "Exemption Clause, person suffering from short or long-term sickness or injury may defer their examination until such time as"… Wait a minute… "Exemption Clause, person suffering from short or long-term sickness or injury may defer their examination…" (laughs).

FRAN: No, no, give it up, Bernard. No, you'd have to really cripple yourself. You're hardly gonna do that just to avoid taking an exam.

BERNARD grins manically.

CAM431R 03:28. BERNARD is drawing a line across his hand with a black marker pen.

CAM431R 03:29. BERNARD is holding up an electrical meat cleaver over his hand.

CAM431R 03:32. BERNARD, arm in a sling and covered in bandages (but no missing limbs), is sitting in a chair, leg on a makeshift hobbling post, holding up a hammer.

CAM431R 03:36. BERNARD now has his foot in a cast and a plaster on his right thumb and is pacing around the room.

CAM431R 03:41. BERNARD is lying in bed with a large bandage around his forehead.

CAM431R 03:42. BERNARD bolts upright.

BERNARD: (manically) Food… food…

BERNARD forages around the room. He comes to the sink and picks up a ceramic mug and a coffee jar. He picks up a spoon, takes a spoonful of coffee and deposits it in the mug, and pours the hot water in the kettle in the coffee jar and drinks it.

CAM169H 03:43. BERNARD breaks into the ventilation shaft outside his quarters and climbs in.

CAM431R 03:44. MANNY comes into the room.

MANNY: Bernard? Have you got… oh.

MANNY sits in a chair and hums to himself. There is a rustling in the cupboard by the sink. MANNY, curious, gets up, walks over to the sink, gets down on his haunches, opens the cupboard door and pulls out a cat, NIPSY.

MANNY: Where'd you come from?

ARNOLD is passing by when he idly looks in and sees MANNY holding the cat. ARNOLD looks with a large grin and starts writing in his report book.

MANNY: (sighing) Ah.

RIMMER creeps up behind MANNY.

RIMMER: (smug) Ah, naughty naughty, mister Bianco. Breaking Quarantine? Ooh, that's a six-month stasis sentence at least!

MANNY turns around.

MANNY: What? But… this isn't mine-

NIPSY jumps out of MANNY's grasp and runs off.

CAM192K 03:46. MANNY is sat in EVAN's office. EVAN is staring at MANNY with his arms folded.

MANNY: I think we should talk about this.

EVAN: (serious) I need a sign, Manny. A sign that you can change. I need you to do something for me.

MANNY: What?

EVAN: (hoarsely) I think you know.

EVAN walks to the far wall and presses a button. A red light clicks on illuminating the inside of a machine in the wall looking similar to a microwave.

MANNY: What, you want me to cook you a pasty?

Another red light comes on illuminating the word "Disintegrator" over the machine. MANNY recoils.

MANNY: Gargh!

EVAN: (dramatically) The cat, Manny!

MANNY: (pleading) No!

EVAN: It's a wall between you and the officers, between you and me, between YOU and the future!

MANNY: Not the Cat! Can't we talk about this?

EVAN: (hoarsely) The time for talking is over. It's time.

BRIAN comes in holding NIPSY. EVAN passes NIPSY to MANNY and leads him to the Disintegrator. MANNY looks down at NIPSY in self-pity, then back to EVAN. EVAN nods solemnly.

MANNY: Evan, please, this is something I have to do myself.

EVAN nods sympathetically.

EVAN: Of course.

EVAN and BRIAN leave the room and close the door behind them. MANNY places NIPSY in the Disintegrator and closes the door.

MANNY: (sobbing) Oh! No, no, no…

MANNY pulls the Disintegrator door open, pulls NIPSY out, opens a vent grill and lets NIPSY out through the vent.

CAM159K 03:49. EVAN and a small group of officers are waiting outside the office.

EVAN: How are you doing in there, Manny? (pause) We're all rooting for you out here.

After a second, EVAN knocks on the door.

EVAN: (urgently) Manny?

EVAN knocks even more.

EVAN: Manny!

Finally, EVAN bursts through the door.

CAM192L 03:49. EVAN bursts through the door and sees that it is completely empty.

EVAN: (shouting in rage) MANNY!

CAM431R 03:49. MANNY runs in out of the corridors and finds BERNARD lying in bed.

MANNY (shocked) Bernard! What happened to you?

BERNARD: (weakly) Manny, I don't feel so good. Like I've been beaten up… underwater. I can feel bits of my brain falling away like a wet cake.

BERNARD has a hacking cough and sits upright.

BERNARD: (hoarsely) I HATE wet cake!

EVAN comes in menacingly.

EVAN: Manny!

MANNY and BERNARD turn to face EVAN.

EVAN: (hoarsely) Come here!

MANNY: (terrified) Bernard, he wants the cat!

BERNARD slides himself out of bed.

BERNARD (weakly, becoming stronger) How dare you?

EVAN looks quizzed.

BERNARD: Don't you touch a hair on this boy's head. Have you no respect? He's mine! Get your own human plaything! You quart-brained little cream puff!

BERNARD swings his fist at EVAN, misses the mark completely and topples over.

CAM431R 03:52 TIM leads MANNY to the STASIS ROOM.

TIM (sadly): Manny, if it's any consolation, I know what you're going through right now. I mean, when we got Colin, I was scared stiff of dogs. But it just doesn't feel the same now he's gone.

MANNY: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

TIM: I just want you to know, I'd probably do the same in your position.

MANNY: Thanks.

TIM opens the door and MANNY steps in. TIM solemnly closes the door.

TIM: Fran… activate Stasis.

FRAN: Yes, Tim.

TIM waves and walks away. Within seconds MANNY is frozen in time.

CAM557H 04:17. MIKE is sitting in the SECURITY ROOM. He puts his mug down for a moment when he sees NIPSY on the monitor running around in the STORAGE AREA.

MIKE: (sighing) Awww.

MIKE then realises what this means and jumps up, spilling his coffee in the process. While he mops it up, a warning light lights up next to a label marked "Drive Plates". Another one in "Core Overload" also lights up. Assuming it to be the result of his clumsiness, MIKE shrugs and continues mopping.

TO BE CONTINUED IN THREE MILLION YEARS.
