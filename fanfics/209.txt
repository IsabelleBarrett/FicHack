Oh! And I don't anything from this! Although I wish that Pokemon were in real life, that'll never happen. :'(



Prologue




Crack



A black silhouette stopped in alarm of the noise. Trying to stop its heavy panting from running such a long distance, Sapphire eyes peered out into the green field, illuminated by the full moon's light. Laughing to itself slightly, a small red and black paw stepped out from the bush and anyone who could see the creature would've tried to catch it immediately.

As the Zorua stepped out from the shadows, it walked towards the small pond, intending to take a drink. The soft grass tickled it's feet as the dew drops from the fresh meadow whetted it's paws. Smiling slightly, the Pokemon reached the lake and felt the cold, refreshing water slide down it's throat.

"Gary! Where are you?!" A female's voice yelled through the darkness. The Zorua's ears perked up as a teenager stepped into the meadow. It's sapphire eyes widened in alarm and it quietly dashed into the bush, thankfully to it's black coat, it wasn't seen.

"Yea! I'm coming Daisy!" The boy yelled back, shredding the night's silence with his voice. Sighing the male got back up from his sitting position by the lake and walked away.
Gary...
The Zorua thought to itself. Tilting it's head in a curios way, it left the forest to find something to eat.
