Humphrey was the first one to wake up he looked around and saw all the girls were cuddles up against him sleeping couldnt help but smile.

"They look like angels" he said to himself

Humphrey decided to get up so he slowly and carfully got up trying not to desturb the sleeping females.

As he managed to get himself free he saw that Candy had woken.

"Humphrey...where are you going?" She asked now fully awake

"Just taking a walk" he replied with a smile.

" Mind if i join you then?" She asked

Humphrey just shrugged his shoulders as he nodded

So then him and Candy left.
