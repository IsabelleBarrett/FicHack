"Dr. Foster, excuse the interruption," said the overweight and feebleminded human 'scientist' for the fifth time since Jane began her speech. "I must question some of your assertions. They seem far too fantastic even for a proposal of this magnitude."

He had a dry, slow way of speaking. If Loki were to guess how the earliest prehistoric man-apes spoke, he'd wager they were poets compared to this buffoon. The only reason he still existed in this plane was because Jane made him swear up and down he'd be on his best behavior.

"I don't care how annoying or stupid they might be," she'd said, "Do not harm them. Do not lift one finger against them."

And he'd given his solemn oath to abide by her rules because for all that she was stubborn and loud and overly excited about the most basic and rudimentary of Asgardian technology, he did love his Jane with all he had in him. So he bit his tongue and kept his hands to himself as Jane tangled with this pompous old fool of a doctor.

"I can assure you, I've seen it all firsthand. Once the bridge is complete, peaceful missions to Asgard will be possible within the next five to ten years," Jane explained.

"Yes, that is a lovely little fancy of yours, Ms. Foster," he said with a wave of his hand. "But I hope you can understand when I say-"

He said nothing after that, not for lack of trying. As he tried and failed to make the words come out, he clutched his throat in alarm and fell off his chair, coughing soundlessly, trying to dislodge the nothing in his throat. Jane glared at Loki, who had not moved a muscle and smiled innocently back at her.

"He is unharmed," he said, "and magic has never required the use of one's hands."
