If you'd like to read it, it's called
Of Love, Trust, and Memories
and I'm advertising it here for a few days just for a little publicity. I know many were wondering how everything turned out, and I hope this three-part tale provides some insight into the futures of Wolfkit, Blossomkit, and Hazelkit.



Love love love,
