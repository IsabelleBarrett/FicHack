Later in Aichi's Room, while everyone is down watching TV
Aichi's POV
Why? WHY why do I have to be so embarrassing? I coulda just replied normally to Misaki then asked if she wanted to room with me, Naoki and Shingo… Im so useless .. *Sad Face*

Misaki's POV
Why was Aichi acting up earlier? I better check on him, wait why am I so worried about Aichi *Flares Red* hmm…
Misaki: *Opens Aichi's door* Aichi? Are you ok?
Aichi: Umm… Umm..Yes Umm, Misaki, can I ask you something?
Misaki: Sure
Aichi: Umm.. uhhh Umm Misaki would you like to live with me, Naoki and Shingo
Misaki: Hmm? *Flares Red*

Misaki's POV
What do I do? I can't just deny him, that would destroy him, should I? He's so cute when he is begging someone, Oh? I just thought he was cute, that means I like him…
Aichi: Well? Misaki?
Misaki: Hmm.. Ok
At the same time downstairs,
Emi: I'm putting a bet on Misaki and Aichi
Kamui: Huh? What about big bro?
Emi: I'm putting a bet on them, I bet Misaki will ask him out first
Kamui: Huh? No, I think bro is going to ask her out first
Back upstairs
Aichi: You really mean it Misaki?
Misaki: Yes, and Aichi?
Aichi: Ye, Yes Misaki?
Misaki: I-I, I think I like you *Blush*
Aichi: Misaki, I.. I think I like you too
Misaki: *Flares Red*
Aichi: *Flares Red*


So, thats it for Chapter 1, I know it's just dialogue, but you get the story, hopefully

Misaki: That felt so much better relaying my feelings to Aichi
Aichi: It did? well I thought so too
Misaki: I .. love you Aichi
Aichi: I love you too Misaki ...
Emi: I knew it, Misaki would be the one to ask Aichi out
Kamui: aww... congrats bro, you won Misaki's heart
Misaki &amp; Aichi: *Flares Red*
Kai: Can I just go? And why are we even talking, outside of the story?
Miwa: Kai... come on, it's fun talking to those people, maybe you could find a challenger
Kai: I guess...

Author: And that's a wrap!
