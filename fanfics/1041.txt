Usually I don't really care about that sort of thing, in fact I support it but half the Intelligence fandom is just drabbles and I was the first one to do it and like I said it feels really discouraging to me. I love Intelligence and I did enjoy writing these but now every time I go to write something all I can think is has someone already done this and is it as good as everyone else's (is it good enough for the fandom.) It has become an extremely negative point for me and I have enough of that in my life already. I really appreciate the support you have all given me and I am extremely sad that I have to do this.
