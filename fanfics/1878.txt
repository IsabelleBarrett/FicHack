Robin just sat there and cried. He cried for a while. He sat in his room, and would lie on the bed, dare not opening his eyes. Having the only person to ever matter to you get murdered tends to have its toll on people.


Even though you only knew him for two minutes.


"SHUT UP!" Robin screamed. "I HATE YOU, BECAUSE YOU DID THIS TO ME!"


Ouch. That's a little rude. True, but rude.


Robin tried to grab something and throw it, but he saw nothing. The room was empty. Stripped bare: all of Robin's belongings were gone. Even his hidden gold stash, which he had hoped to escape with, was missing.

All that was left was a single note. Robin limped toward it, sobbing all of the way.

He grabbed it and read it.


Dear Bubbles (haha because all you do is cry)



I took your stuff because you're a loser. I was just kidding when I acted polite to you. I actually hate you. But not as much as I hate candy. But close. I took your stuff. But I left you this oversized bag of chocolate. But I poisoned it. Because candy is gross. And I made it taste more gross.



-Love, Gaius


Robin felt his blood boil.

After everything he had gone through, this had felt like the last straw.


"GAIUSSSS!"
he screamed.
"I WILL FIND YOU, AND I WILL KILL YOU!"


Suddenly the door bursted open.

In came Panne, the taguel.

"H-H-Hi." she said. "I-I-I believe you are in need of assistance? I c-c-can sell my hot rr-r-rabbit body to you to help."

Robin groaned. "I just want to find Gaius."

"O-O-Oh okay. That'll b-b-be ten th-thousand gold."

Robin sighed. "Gaius has my money. Can I pay you back later?"

"O-O-O-Ohhhhh... No can do. I o-o-o-only ac-c-cept on the s-spot p-p-payment."

Robin growled, before stomping out of the room and looking around.

He was in a hallway. Most of the doors were empty, from what he could tell, except for one.

Miriel's room.

He stomped on over to the doors, before angrily pounded on it.

Eventually, the woman opened the door.

She was wearing such clean clothes, and had a very sophisticated look.

She seemed intelligent at first glance.

But Robin dared not to get his hopes up.

"Likeeeeeee... What do ya want maaaaan...?" Miriel asked. That explained the fumes.

Robin was glad he didn't get his hopes up. "I need to find Gaius. Right. Now."

"Oh... Likee... I dunno a Gaius... But, likeee... I know a Bob... But... Who is Bob...? I dunno ma-!"

Robin slammed the door. This was clearly useless.

Suddenly Frederick was by him. And said Frederick was shirtless.

"Hey Chrom wants us to go walk outside and march for a few days or something. So..." But Robin understood. He braced for impact.

Luckily the punches in the face were starting to hurt less.


They were casually marching when

"HEY CHROM!" Frederick yelled. "GIMME SOME EXPOSITION!"

Chrom shrugged. "Whatevs. You see, we're walking Emmeryn to this other castle because we're rich and we have other castles. Why we're doing this when we have a perfectly capable destroyer of worlds? I dunno. Also that shifty guy over there is a family friend, and by that I mean he's our creepy uncle."

The creepy uncle hierarch made an unintelligible noise.

Robin cried again.

Suddenly Plegian soldiers appeared.

"Now now! My noble Ylissean friends! I, The humble knight Vasto, have been commanded by my greatest of kings Gangrel to take you into custody!" A wyvern rider swoops in. "Worry not, for my soldiers and I will not lay a finger on anyone!"

Suddenly the creepy uncle hierarch scrambled onto the battle. He made a loud pig noise.

"Ah, it is you, our kind informant! The kingdom is completely thankful for your cooperation in giving us the location of the Ylissean royal guard!" he laughed. "Now, we will take you under our protect-!"

Suddenly the creepy uncle hierarch squealed and ran directly into the lance of a nearby soldier. He was impaled.

"OH MY GODS THE PLEBIANS JUST SLAUGHTERED OUR FAMILY FRIEND!" Chrom screamed. "THESE GODDAMN MONSTERS!"

"KILL THEM ALL CHROM!" Emmeryn screams. She angrily pointed forward, and Frederick immediately rushed into the fray.

With a single thrust of his lance, he impaled hundreds of soldiers.

"AhhhhhhYourGraceIWillBringYouToSafetyyyy!" Phila screamed as she grabbed Emmeryn and jumped off of the cliff.

"Oh crap. This is nice I guess." Suddenly a pegasus casually trotted onto the battlefield. "So now the other pegasus knights that were supposed to protect the border are having tea, or some stupid stuff. I don't really care."

Phila suddenly climbed back out of the canyon."AhhhhhhhhCordeliaWhatAreYouDoingHere" She promptly fell back into the canyon.

"I already told you. Everyone's having tea. Dumbass." Cordelia groaned. "I don't really care. I'm gonna take a nap or some-!"

Suddenly Chrom walked up. "Heeeey! It's the hot one!" He leaned closer. "Heeeey baby. You wanna have a little S-Support?"

The redheaded pegasus knight started screaming. Not with happiness, to Robin's relief.

"AHHHHHHH! GET AWAY FROM ME YOU CREEPY ASS PERVERT DONT YOU LOOK AT ME I WILL CUT YOU UP!" She pulled out her lance and started violently swinging it at the prince.

Robin rubbed his eyes, looking amongst the chaos.

He thought about his encounter with Miriel.

Maybe he had inhaled too many fumes?


Hah! You wish.


Suddenly, the fighting ceased.

"IT IS YOU!" Robin yelled. "YOU DID THIS TO US!"

Emmeryn climbed back onto the cliff. "I DONT CARE WHO OR WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT! KILL THEM." She fell back into the canyon.


Whoa whoa whoa. Hold. On. Try not to murder me yet.



...



Aaaand now they're throwing their weapons in the air.



...



Guys. I'm not physically here.


"I DONT CARE!" Robin screams.


Eh... I'm just gonna pull up a linebreak or something.



Finally, the battling was over. The Plegian forces were all singlehandedly taken out by Frederick. He didn't even need to put on his shirt.

"OkaySoWhatHappenedToYouCordelia?" Phila asked.

"They're drinking tea. I already told you." Cordelia groaned. She wiped Chrom's blood off of her lance.

"Oh that reminds me." Emmeryn says. "I'm gonna go head back to Ylisstol and trigger a mass execution. I just kinda feel like it."

"W-What about us, sister?!" Lissa asks.

"I dunno. Just go to Fairfox or whatever it's called. Also..." Emmeryn pulls the Fire Emblem out of nowhere. "Take this Macguffin, Chrom. I guess it'll be important or something."

As soon as Chrom grabbed it, Emmeryn hopped on Phila's mount and sped off at the speed of sound.


"So... Now what?" shirtless Frederick asked.

"I dunno. I'm still trying to figure out why we're chilling in the middle of this arena." Chrom says.

Robin pauses. He didn't even notice.

"SNAP OUT OF IT!" Sumia suddenly ran up to Chrom. She arched her arm backward. "Sumia... PAAWNNNNNCHHHHHH!" Her fist bursts into the flame, before slamming into Chrom at the speed of light.

Chrom's face explodes.

Everyone laughs. "I believe that you are supposed to slap people with an open palm." Lissa giggles.

"Slap?! Hah. No. I wanted to break that dude's face. I saw him hitting on that redheaded chick. I hate that redheaded chick."

Flavia shrugs. "I'd say this is love, but this is definitely abuse."

Basilio walks in. "Yeah. Uh. By the way. I got good news and bad news."

"Whas sha gewd newsh" Chrom's battered face attempts to ask.

"The good news is, I have a haircut." Basilio smiles.

"You don't have hair, my lovely, bald, beautiful-!" Flavia suddenly jumps on him.

Robin gags. He thought the PDA was bad enough with Chrom and Sumia.

"Also," Basilio says between breaths, "Ylisstol, your home city that you hold dear, has fallen."

"Oeh noeeeee" Chrom cries.

Basilio gets back up. "So. Uh. Emmeryn is being personally brought to the capital of Plegia for a peace negotiation."

Lissa faints.

Chrom gasps. "THOSE MONSTERS!"

Basilio frowns. "Now, we better not rush into things here, we have to be really careful when thinking of a plan."

Chrom shrugs. "Okay."

...

"Yeah. We definitely don't want to rush into a trap."

"K."

"It would be a real shame if a certain army ran by a blue haired prince tried to rescue her."

"Whatevs."

"IM TRYNA SAY YOU WALK UP THERE AND SLAP THAT KANG SILLY THE FACE YOU BLUE HAIRED FREAK." Basilio screams.

Chrom groans. "Fine. Whatever." he turns toward Robin. "Think of a perfect plan, Rob-Bro."

Robin sighs.



A/N: I think I've long since stopped inverting personalities, and have instead just given people whatever personality I felt like them having. It's nice I guess.



I'll update this again eventually.
