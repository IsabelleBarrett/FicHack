Pansy liked to leave up Christmas decorations for as long as she could. If it were up to her, she'd probably never bother taking them down. She liked having the whole world decked in pine branches and baubles (which were, after all, frequently in Slytherin colours), and she liked leaving piles of wrapping paper around so that she could be reminded of gifts that she'd received.

Most of all, she liked keeping sprigs of mistletoe under all the doorways.

"You have to kiss me," she told Padma, every time Padma walked under one of them. "You're under the mistletoe."

Padma rolled her eyes. "I don't celebrate Christmas."

"Yes you do!"

"Not in March, I don't."

Pansy jutted out her lower lip. "It doesn't matter anyway. It's not about Christmas. It's about you kissing me. Now."
