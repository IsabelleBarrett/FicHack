I bet you all have at least heard this over and over again, but you're going to hear it again. Welcome to the world of Pokémon! And in this world are wonderful creatures that can be our best friends and our battle partners. No Ash Ketchum here, because this time we are going to the region of Rijon! Now, we are going to look at a young boy named Freddie. Today Freddie just turned ten and he is going to get his Pokémon license from the regions professor, Professor Tom.

"Freddie! Time to get up and get dressed you get your Pokémon partner today!" Freddie's mother shouted across the house.
