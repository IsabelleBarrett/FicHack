

He is the Liesmith.

Words are his domain and he knows their power. He uses them to tear down, to pierce masks and reveal intent. They are his greatest weapon, even when—
especially when—
they are his only weapon.

Like now, when he is brought chained before the king, wearing new armor and a grin even he knows is slightly manic.

This will be easy. He'll get Odin to keep him prisoner instead of killing him.

Oh, if all he has is his words, he'll use them. He'll listen to everyone and
hear
them. He'll knowwhat they'll say and he'll know why they said it, even when they don't. He'll listen to the words— he'll
use
the words, the glorious aching words that splattered uselessly during most of New York and he'll wield them to the absolute best of his ability.

He is Loki. He is the Liesmith, Silvertongue, a wrangler and a trickster.

Listen carefully, Asgard.

Listen to the words.



A/N: thus begins a series of one-shots about words during Thor: The Dark World. As always, let me know what you think! I make no promises about regular updating, but when the inspiration strikes or a word suddenly sticks out in meaning when I rewatch this movie for the fourth time or something I'll probably update. I've a couple simmering already, which helped me decide to post this. This is more of an announcement or a prologue, I guess.



Should be fun!
