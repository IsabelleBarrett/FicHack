So, I've put this story on Hiatus because I can't really work on this right now. I'm not too busy, well, I am, it's just... the


story


. I write things that I've experienced, for the most part, and when I


write


about cutting and depression, I start to relapse. I'm really sorry, and I feel horrible about it, but I just have to so this. Hopefully, when I get better, I can work on it again, but until then, I have to stop this story. I'll still work on others that don't contain such heavy content, though, because believe it or not I can write happy too.



Sorry for the wait, - Kris
