Himeno coughed a few times after she finished screaming, her lungs crying out for oxygen, her knuckles white from the force of her grip on the railings. She straightened up and looked out at the view from the roof of her home. "Seriously! What is her problem? Doesn't she get tired of pulling pranks on me every single day? She's so childish! Stupid Mayune." Himeno muttered as he rested her elbows on the railings and laid her head in her hands.

"Feel better after that?" asked a voice that Himeno immediately recognised. She spun around and came almost face to face with Sasame. Who smiled at her before sitting down with his back to the wall. Himeno looked down at the Leafe Knight feeling both confused and embarrassed.

"Why are you up here?" she asked as he sat down next to the handsome boy. Sasame smiled, "I've been up here for a while. Hayate had something to take care of, so he asked me to keep an eye on you." Himeno nodded and sat down beside him. "How long have you been coming up here?" Sasame asked as he tilted his head back to look at the stars in the darkening sky.

"Quite a while, it's the best place to go because no one would think of looking up here." Himeno replied as she also looked up at the stars. "Good point but if you're going to keep coming here, you need to promise me something." He said seriously making Himeno open one eye to look at him. "What's that?"

"You have to warn me if you're going to yell like that again. I nearly had a heart attack!" Himeno chuckled as she gently pushed Sasame, "I will, I promise."
