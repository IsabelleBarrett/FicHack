

This is my second ficcy be kind please! I don't own Zombie Loan or any other wildly successful manga!


My Zombies


These are my zombies,

one cloaked in black and one in white.

They may be dead,

but they live in full color and light.

They still feel pain and their blood is still red.

No matter their state my boys are still human.

Even though I still live,

they show me how to truly be alive.

Without them I would be alone.

To each his own loan.

I love their sarcastic smiles,

I even like their cynical wiles.

My zombies. My boys. My very best friends.
