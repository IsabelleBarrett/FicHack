The Thunder Below Deck


While Red had no sympathy for Team Rocket, he couldn't help but feel sorry for their Pokemon. Like that Rhydon at Mt Moon, driven to senseless rage by whatever poison forced through its hide. Like that Electabuzz of Lieutenant Surge that was kept chained on the lower decks.

Red had been shocked, even more so than when the Voltorb had surrounded Poli and him. He'd been thrice shocked when the Electabuzz had shocked them
through
the floor – and when he'd seen a flash of his face before he was tossed off the ship.

He'd never met an Electabuzz before that, but he'd never met a Gyarados before Misty's either, and she was pretty adamant that the rumours surrounding that species were fault, despite her Pokemon's behaviour. 'Team Rocket's fault,' she said, and Red was reminded of that when he thought of Lieutenant Surge's Electabuzz. He was reminded of how that Rhydon had changed before them, as soon as that poison trickled into its veins.

He didn't understand how people could do such horrible things to Pokemon – and not only others' Pokemon (which was bad enough) but their own. Because he didn't believe Electabuzz were truly that battle-hungry, that vicious. The chains and isolation probably didn't help…and, well, Red couldn't help but feel sorry for it – once he was no longer drowning in an unforgiving ocean of course.
