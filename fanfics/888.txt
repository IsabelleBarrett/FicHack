The sun reflected on their sweaty foreheads as they tried to make their ways through the paved streets over run by the assembled crowd. ''Yalla! Yalla!'' the impatient urging could be heard at almost every street corner . The entire city seemed to have suddenly come to life as every nook and crack of the old kingdom capital became filled with excitement upon seeing an ornate carrige making its way to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher under the blazing afternoon sun. The heat was unbearable even for this time of July but the marble of the church walls and pillars offered a much needed relief from the terrible heat. The cold sensation of ancient marble and the ever spreading scent of thyme seemed almost surreal. The fluttering spectrum of noble ladies' dresses almost...overpowering. A barely noticeable figure that stood at the foot of the altar started to grab the attention of the gathered crowd of noblemen as it desperately tried to free itself of the shackles that were the sleeves of its formal attire. The figure then proceeded to recite carefully learned phrases while trying not to break the mask of pretense confidence. Its voice was still that of a young boy , struggling to hide the growing tension in its voice behind forced formality. The boy's his blue eyes eagerly searched the crowd in hopes of finding a familiar face among the assembled audience of noblemen as a golden crown lowered itself on his blonde head. ''Long live the king!''
The cold church was suddenly replaced with the colorful sight of flowers blooming in the courtyard as he broke away from the memory. It has been too many years since he has vowed to rule Jerusalem and prevent the Holy Land from falling into the hands of heathens. King Baldwin, the fourth of that name to to rule the Promised land.
