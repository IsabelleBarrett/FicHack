But, what I'd like to do first is to rewrite it. I started this story about three years ago, I think, and I'd like to give it the treatment it deserves. So what will happen is this; I'll keep both the Kazekage's Keeper up, and Defined up as well, but I'll rewrite The Kazekage's Keeper and put it up as 'A Keeper and her Charge'. I love the story and world that I created, but now that I'm older and more adept at writing, I think I can make that story even better. So please, if you've liked what you've read, follow me for updates, and I assure you that you won't be disappointed!
