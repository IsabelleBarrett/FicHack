I played with this for all I was worth, and he let me stay in his office with a tray to lean on so I could get on with paperwork. It was a lot easier to work whilst lounging on a comfy sofa with a blanket round my shoulders and a bottle of coke beside me.
"Will?"
He looked over at me. "Yes, Ronald?"
"Can I still come back with you tonight?" I asked.
"I don't see why not"
I moved my work stuff aside and went over to him, climbing onto his lap. I expected him to sigh and push me away but he put his pen down and hugged me hard.
"There now, Ronnie. I know they gave you a bit of a shock earlier"
I opened my mouth to argue, but his tone was soft and calming and I just relaxed against him instead.
"Love you, Will"
He took my face in his hands and kissed me gently.
"I love you too, Ronald"
