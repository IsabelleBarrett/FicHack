"Hiding underground with the cool kids
I just choose to not want to choose things
We're living different lives"

"Raiden! Please bring us some tea!" Tamaki's hand fluttered in the air.

"Hai, Tamaki-senpai!" Raiden rushed between sofas and scattered tables. He arrived promptly behind the sofa his senpai and his guests were currently sitting at.

"Ladies, have you met my newest apprentice? This is Raiden Moriyama."

Raiden had moved around the sofa with a tray in hand. He placed it on the table gently before bowing, "It is a pleasure to meet all of your acquaintances."

Some girls giggled. "What brings you to the host club, Raiden-kun?"

"Oh, you know, I just want to be able to talk to pretty girls a little better," he shot them a grin. The girls giggled again.

"Perfect! Raiden!" Tamaki shot out thumbs up. Raiden bowed again and swiftly walked away.

He pushed his cart around. I love the host club, he thought happily. He still couldn't believe they agreed to let him join. He hoped they would give them a chance after he found out Fujioka was allowed to join.

Last Monday he finally gathered the courage and found himself at the third music room. He was surprised to find a fifth year elementary student in the clubroom, but grateful because if it were not for the eleven year old, Tamaki probably would not have agreed to let him join.

It seemed at the time the king of the host club was a little emotionally unstable and needed reassurance that he was indeed a great host and teacher.

Raiden stopped next to Haruhi's table. "Would you ladies like some tea or cake?" He said with a smile, his smile tugging a little harder considering he really was asking everyone at the table. He recognized the girls from his class, but he couldn't quite place their names.

"Oh, thank you Raiden. I'd like some tea," the girl with light brown hair said.

"I'd like some lemon cake please," a girl with jet-black hair blushed.

"I'm on it." Raiden lifted a porcelain teacup. When he began to pour the tea something caught his eye.

His eyes landed on Kaoru and Hikaru. The boys were wrapped around each other causing the girls around them to squeal. He could feel himself sighing softly.

He turned back to the tea he was pouring and noticed he almost spilt the hot tea onto his hand. Hoping the girls didn't notice, he placed the cup back on its respective plate and placed it on the table in front of the girl. He knelt down near the bottom tray and cut a perfect slice of cake.

"It is so nice to see you here, Raiden," the girl waiting for her cake said.

"Really? Why do you say that?" He placed the cake down in front of her.

"It's nice to see you outside the classroom. That's all," she offered him another smile.

He returned it with another bright grin. "Enjoy yourselves ladies."

He pushed his cart away from Haruhi and her guests. He found himself making his way toward his upperclassmen. He braced himself for Hani-senpai's onslaught of cuteness.

Hani must have spotted him from the corner of his eye because he jumped out of his seat happily and pranced toward Raiden.

"Rai-chan! Did you bring me some yummy cake today?" Hani peaked underneath the cart, his eyes landing on five different cakes.

"Hani-senpai, I've brought different cakes for your choosing." Raiden parked his little cart next to Hani and Mori-senpai's main area.

Hani once again settled down in between two girls who giggled at his antics.

"Hello, Mori-senpai. Would you like some tea?" Mori nodded silently. Raiden quickly poured his senpai a cup and placed it gently down in front of him.

"Hani-senpai?" Raiden looked over at him happily. Hani grinned. "What kind of cake would you like to eat today?"

"I want the lemon cake!"

Raiden nodded and began to cut a piece. Once he was done, he placed the plate filled with cake down in front of Hani. "Enjoy!"

He continued this routine until club hours were over. He tapped his leg pocket unconsciously and found something amiss. His cellphone was missing.

Reina tugged at her skirt reluctantly. She couldn't believe her brother was making her do this. She gazed up at the tall pristine walls. Clean. Royal like. Pink?

"I'd forgotten how grand this place was," She quietly said to herself. She entered through two large French doors. Music Room 3, the little paper she held read.

"I don't know the first place to look for this damn room."

A tall gangly boy with crimson red hair crossed in front of her. "Excuse me," she called out, daring to get closer, "I'm looking for music room 3. Do you know where it is?"

"Huh!" The boy held a glare.

"I'm looking for music room 3," Reina said cautiously.

"Can't help you!" He said quickly and stomped off.

The environment was completely foreign. Reina had never been in the high school wing of Ouran Academy before.

"Third music room." Reina said to herself. "Does that mean it's on the third floor? Is there three floors?" She gazed around looking for a staircase.

Just then a small group of girls walked into the lobby, wearing yellow cupcake shaped dresses.

Those are cute, Reina thought innocently, looking down at her own drab uniform. Ours are pretty boring and normal.

"Excuse me." Reina jogged over to the girls. They looked at her with surprise, their brown curls bouncing along with their head. "Um, can you help me find the third music room?"

One of the girls stifled a giggle behind her hand. "You're looking for the host club?" She asked.

"Uh, yeah. I have to drop something off but I don't know where to start looking. I'm sorry." Reina quickly apologized.

"It's not problem." The girl on the left said. "You just go down this hall and you make a right. The main staircase will be right there. You go to the third floor and you take a left. It'll be the last door in the south wing."

"Thank you so much. I appreciate it." She bowed quickly before making her way toward the staircase. Reina took the stairs two at a time, reaching the third floor in a matter of minutes. She followed the girl's directions, walking rather quickly down the hall, but taking in all the sights that Ouran Academy had. Reina slowed to a stop in front of the door to the third music room.

"I'm sorry for the late notice, Kyouya-senpai," Raiden's eyes remained on the floor.

"It's alright, Raiden. Since club hours are over I don't think it should cause any problem." Kyouya smirked but it did not seem very appeasing.

"Uh, thanks Kyouya-senpai."

Hani emerged from nowhere, "Rai-chan, your sister is coming?"

"Yeah, I forgot my phone at home and I asked her if she could come drop it off but since it's the end of the day it seems kind of pointless now. I didn't really think this through," he whispered the last part.

"Does your sister look like you, Raiden?" Haruhi asked. He was standing next to Hani.

"Oh yeah, a lot of people say we look like twins actually," he rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed, "but I don't believe them really. We don't look anything alike."

Suddenly, a soft clicking sound echoed around the room. All eyes flew to the door.

A head peaked out. "Raiden," it whispered.

A girl entered the room but she donned the ill-fated uniform the whole club hated, except Raiden, Haruhi, and Kyouya of course.

"Whoa, it's really pretty in he-ahh"

A flurry of blond took over her vision and then darkness.

"Tamaki-senpai!"

# # #

"Mori-senpai! Thank goodness you're here. Can you help me move her?"

"What were you thinking Tamaki-senpai?"

"Wah, I. Well. Look at her uniform!"

"Ooh," a pair of voices droned.

"She's my sister! I told you she would be visiting today!"

"Rai-chan. I didn't know Reina Moriyama was your sister."

"Kaoru, doesn't she look familiar?"

"She sure does, Hikaru. But from where?"

"Tamaki-senpai. Kyouya-senpai. This is my sister, Reina. She attends St. Lobelia Women's Institute."

"Yes I am aware! What is she doing here? The Zuka club changed their tactics and are sending attractive young women here to steal our Haruhi?!"

Reina's eyes began to open. Eight pairs of blinking eyes stared down at her. Her face scrunched up in confusion.

"Reina, are you okay?" She heard her brother's calm voice amid the confusion.

"What happened?" She tried to get up. "Ooh. Ow. My head." She held a hand to her head but her brother was already there with an ice pack.

"My senpai tackled you." He said again calmly.

"Oh. Okay." She clutched the ice herself. Raiden stood back to watch her. "Wait, what? Why did he tackle me? I thought this was a host club not some American football gang or...oh I can't do this." Reina lay back down.

"Mademoiselle, I am so sorry. It was I who knocked you down. I thought you were someone else." Tamaki looked sincere.

"Do you usually tackle girls when they walk into a room?"

Snickers could be heard behind them.

"Oh. Reina this is Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin." Raiden moved her attention to two boys who looked identical. He moved around to grab another arm. "This is Haruhi Fujioka. They're all in my class."

"Wait, one boy with two names or is there really two boys standing in front of me?" Reina grimaced.

"Two boys," the twins answered for her in a playful tone.

"Nee-chan," Raiden's voice sounded almost motherly.

"Moriyama-senpai." Everyone's attention moved to the dark haired teen with glasses. "What brings you here?"

"Ootori-kun," she paused, "Well, I was bringing something for my brother." She stuck her hand into her pocket and brought out a white cellphone. Raiden looked confused. How did his sister know Kyouya?

"Next time call Akihiko to bring it. I almost died this time."

"I'm so sorry!" Tamaki wailed in the background.

"I should go now." Reina stood up from her seat. Raiden grabbed her arm gently. "I'll walk you down."

"Wait! Rei-chan!"

The Moriyama siblings turned around at the same time.

"Haninozuka-kun. Morinozuka-kun." Reina felt her face begin to warm. "Oh, it's so great to see you but I can't chat right now. I have the sudden urge to throw up and that's a bad sign...I might have a concussion." She made another movement to the door.

"Come back another day, Rei-chan!" Hani waved.

Reina simply nodded. The siblings began to move toward the door when Kyouya's voice stopped them. "Senpai, I think it would be best if we got you to a hospital. I can have a car drive you there immediately."

"What? No I can't let you do that." She gripped the ice pack closer to her head trying not to wince.

"No, I'm sure it's the least we could do," Kyouya shot Tamaki a look. Tamaki cowered in the corner.

"I don't want to impose on you any further."

"It's nothing." Kyouya walked up to the brother and sister.

"Raiden, why don't you wait here? I'll make sure your sister gets proper care."

Kyouya took Reina's arm in his and walked out of the room swiftly.

"Did Kyouya-senpai just steal my sister?" Raiden looked at the door confused.

# # #

"It was great seeing you again, Moriyama-senpai. Although, I wish our goodbyes were on better terms," Kyouya offered her his best host smile as she settled into the backseat of his car. His driver was waiting to drive to the nearest Ootori hospital.

"Ootori-kun, you didn't need to do this."

"Of course I did. Take care of yourself and tell your father I said hello." Kyouya shut the door and stepped away from the curb.

"Ootori?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you for taking care of my brother." Reina rolled up the window, but Kyouya was able to see the flush of red spread across her cheeks.

"Hani-senpai, Mori-senpai, how do you know my sister?" Raiden was helping Haruhi clean up the clubroom.

Hani was seated at a small round table eating cake by the mouthful. "She used to be our classmate. I knew your last name sounded familiar. Didn't you think it sounded familiar, Takashi?"

Mori nodded his head.

"Yup, I recognized her right away." Hani took another bite and swallowed. "Her hair is a lot shorter though."

"Why doesn't she attend Ouran anymore?" Haruhi asked, she paused in her chores.

"I don't really know. I never really asked her," Raiden looked down at the floor.

"You never asked your own sister why she doesn't go to the same high school as you?" Kaoru asked surprised.

Raiden was taken aback. His eyes landed on Kaoru. He did not want Kaoru to think bad of him but he had to say the truth. "No."

"It seems you two have some communication issues." Hikaru commented harshly.

Raiden looked away from the twins. An overwhelming sense of shame moved around in his stomach.
