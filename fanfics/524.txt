WMHS WITH AJ AND RYLIEE TALKING AMONGST THEMSELVES BY A FEW LOCKERS

AJ: Why couldn't mom stick with dad, then we would be happier

Ryliee: because mom can't keep a damn boy to save her life

AJ: Because she can't keep her mouth shut, her singing drove them away

Ryliee: You have her nose though

AJ: You have dads skin tone

Ryliee: whatever, i can play guitar

AJ: I can sing better than you so you need to back up Taylor not so Swift

Ryliee: ha ha ha you think your so funny when you just need to come out the closet

Paris: *walks into the school with a bunch of coffee, she walks by AJ &amp; Ryliee*

AJ: Shut up , you're more likely to have a teen pregnancy and you'll date a guy as dumb as Finn Hudson

Paris: *stops to listen*

Ryliee: You're dumber than Finn

AJ: Well Natasha is probably smarter than you because if it was up to me and Finn then her name would be drizzle

Paris: *hides behind lockers and thinks: Why are they talking about Finn?*

Ryliee: Finn shouldn't ever have dated mom because after Natasha was born he ran away to college

Paris: *thinks: What….*

AJ: He probably cheated on mom while he was there

Ryliee: Doubt it, does he even know how to cheat or what cheating is?

Paris: *He was with someone?*

AJ: Why are we even at this dumb reunion?

Ryliee: Because mom wants to mourn the loss of her ex stupid boyfriend thats why dumbo

AJ: Dumbo? seriously? you have the huge ears like dad, idiot… Finn's dumbness rubbed off on you

Paris: *starts to cry and hurries and drops off the coffee in the choir room, Mr. Schue says thanks and noticed that she's crying, but before he can ask what's wrong, Paris runs off*

Ryliee: Oh really, fight me dumb ass *shoves him*

AJ: *pulls her hair and slams her into the lockers*

Rachel: GUYS COME ON

Ryliee: MOM MOM MOM MOM MOM

Rachel: WHAT

Ryliee: AJ attacked me out of nowhere again, he picked a fight with me and i told him that fighting is not what you want and he said that he doesn't care and started beating me up

Rachel: Guys stop it and come here

AJ: *walks over* She shoved me first

Ryliee: *Walks over* Your such a liar

Natasha: STOP IT, DADDY WOULD HATE IT IF HE SAW YOU TWO FIGHTING

Anna: did Finn ever um tell you anything while you were together… like he cheated on you..

Savannah: Yeah with Quinn...that's why I don't talk to Quinn anymore

Anna: There was another girl too and well… that girl deserves to be punched in the face

Savannah: Who do I have to punch this time? I need my hands for….nevermind

Paris: oh no problem… I went to college with Finn and we dated and he took off the day before i knew i was pregnant, i never got to tell him about his daughter

Savannah: Why did he "take off", huh because the day he died he was coming to see me cause I NEEDED A RIDE OK I know you're getting your Finns mixed up.

Paris: He wanted to see Family then i dropped out of college and Finn came back to college to finish then he took off again because a girl called Savannah Schuester needed a ride and he was driving so fast that he hit another car and died in the hospital

Savannah: You think this is a joke? Huh? What are you a fucking stalker-

Ryder: Savannah-

Savannah: Too late now isn't it because everything I touch dies *runs off*

Ryder: *looks down*

Paris: Please… tell this other girl that Finn has another daughter, tell the mother of his other daughter to contact me, ASAP because Ayanna needs to know her sister

Ryder: Look, Idk who you are, but it looks like you picked the wrong day to bring this up...if you knew Finn then you know what day it is.

Paris: The day he died…. the day i couldn't make it to see my daughters father for the last time
