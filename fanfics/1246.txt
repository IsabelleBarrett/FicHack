James Potter was three years and two months old exactly when he was first taken for a stroll through muggle London.

Lily Evans was three years and five months old when she went on her first trip to London.

To any given three year old, the streets of a large city are terrifying. To four year old Petunia Evans this was especially true. She clung to her mother in a fashion that most young children would when they were frightened, nervous. She watched her little sister with wide blue eyes, certain that she was going to hurt herself but Petunia was much to scared to voice such an opinion when large, burly blokes and rough looking teenagers were wandering all around them.

Lily Evans was wearing a toothy grin as she galloped ahead of her mother and sister, excited that her first time in muggle London was going to be at a giant, huge, fantastic toy store.

James Potter was not in a happy mood. He didn't like muggle London because Mummy wouldn't levitate him and make flying sounds and he had to stay attached to her hand. Now James liked his mummy's hand and all, but what fun was a hand when he could be flying? And James Potter loved to fly.

James Potter and Lily Evans would never remember this, their first meeting. How could they? They were just three years old. As Lily galloped ahead, she paid no attention to what was in front of her, and James was too focused on figuring out how to convince his mother to let him fly. They collided, much like speeding cars would. And all at once the wailing began and their respective parents picked them up and made their apologies and laughed over the antics of three year old's.

So you see, it wasn't on a train at the age of eleven and James Potter did not fall in love at first sight. They crashed into each other and passed each other by, quite like ships in the night.
