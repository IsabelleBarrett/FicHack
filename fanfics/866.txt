House of Isis



Naomi's POV


We were all walking to our respective classes, and other than the amulet that was in the antechamber at the moment, I hope, we only had the one spare.

"What are we going to do?" Nina asked Fabian.

"If we can't get the amulets back, it's adios to the mask and necklace, the mission's over, and Nina and I will be living in the afterlife." Mira said grimly.

"You never know. Victor might suddenly become all nice. And… what? It could happen." Amber said as I was trying not to laugh at what she just said.

"Sure, right, after Patricia becomes a guidance counselor and Jade joins a punk metal band." Fabian said sarcastically.

"Haha! Like that's gonna happen." Patricia laughed.

"Yeah, you can say that again." Jade said.

"Listen, we just have to keep an eye on Victor. He'll slip up eventually. Then, we're back in business." Patricia said as everyone else nodded in agreement.

"You sure you haven't read the Art of War?" I asked nervously.

"What's that?" Patricia asked me.

"Never mind." I said in relief.


Back at the house



Peter's POV


I was on my way to dinner when I got a text message from Rufus. Why now of all times?! I mean, really?! Sighing, I opened the text, and he wanted to meet tonight after lights out. I put my phone back in my bag and went into the dining room where the others already were when I saw what looked like a cord around Victor's neck, Nina seemed to notice it as well.

"Look at the straps. It's Victor. He's holding the amulets!" Nina exclaimed in a low whisper.

"He's wearing all of them." Fabian replied.

"Great. So, what, he's now the official spokesperson of amulet banking?" Mira asked sarcastically.

"Well, what should we do now?" Patricia asked.

"Wait for him to take them off?" Jade asked.

"Or he takes a shower." Skye said.

"We'll just have to wait until he goes to sleep or something. Then, we can take them off him." Nina said.

"Ohh…. Victor in his pajamas." Patricia said jokingly as I couldn't help but laugh while imagining him in a pair.

"Ugh, I may actually throw up." Amber said.

"Yeah… I don't see him as the type to have pajamas." Naomi said.

"What if he never changes his clothes?" Nina asked.

"That… I can actually imagine." I said.

"The wrench, boy! The wrench!" We heard Victor exclaim from the kitchen.

"Then let's make him change. Watch." Amber said.

She lightly skipped into the kitchen, then unplugged the plug in the kitchen sink, and made the water drain onto Victor! I was actually having trouble holding in my laughter. Everyone else seemed to as well, except for Jerome that is.

"Amber!" Jerome exclaimed.

"Look what you've done, you… ugh! You silly girl! Look at this mess!" Victor exclaimed as he came up from under the kitchen sink.

"I'm sorry Victor, I didn't see you there." Amber said.

"There's no harm done." Vera said as she left the kitchen.

"Victor, you should probably take a shower." Nina said.

"A long one." Mira said.

"Definitely. Like, uh, right now?" Fabian asked.

"It'd help prevent a cold." I said.

"No, thank you. I am quite alright. Somebody get me a clean shirt from the laundry." Victor said as he held up his dirty button-up shirt.

"I'll do it." Alfie said before he shook the shirt, and we recoiled from the dirty water that sprayed off it.

"Lewis!" Victor exclaimed sternly as he hurriedly left the kitchen.


Later that evening



Mira's POV


Alfie told us about his itching powder prank he pulled on Victor inside his shirt. We waited until he began scratching like he had a poison ivy rash.

"Vera?! Vera, would you please fetch me some soothing skin lotion?" We heard Victor call out as he left his office.

Once he started walking downstairs, we opened the door to the girl's dorms, Alfie looking impressed that the itching powder actually worked. I should know, I've been victim of that stuff plenty of times.

"Wow. It worked. I am definitely getting more of that stuff." Alfie said.

"We need to go now." Nina said as she, Fabian, Amber, Jade, Skye, and I entered Victor's office.

"That's it? No one's gonna tell me I'm a genius?" Alfie asked.

"You are a genius in pranks like that one." Naomi said to him.

"Thanks Naomi." Alfie smiled.

We all began searching Victor's office, but no luck. We couldn't find them! Where did he put them?

"Hurry up." Naomi said in worry.

"He'll be back in no time." Peter added in.

"We're doing our best. Where are they?" Nina and I asked in unison.

"15 seconds." Patricia said.

"Make it ten." Naomi said in worry.

"Hurry up, seriously." Alfie said as we continued searching Victor's office.

"Come on guys, you have five seconds." Patricia said as we kept searching.

"Times up. He's coming back now." Naomi said.

In defeat, we all hurried out of Victor's office, and back into the girl's dorms. We were so close!


House of Curfews



Jade's POV


We were all back in Nina's room, as we were just so close to getting the amulets back, but we completely failed.

"If we don't get the amulets back from Victor, there's no way we're ever get back in the tunnels." Patricia said.

"And adios to the mask and necklace." Mira said in frustration.

"Don't worry. It could be worse." Amber said while pulling Mira into a half-hug before whispering something I couldn't hear.

"Whoever you are, wherever you are, know this! It's ten o'clock!" Victor called out.

"Pin drop." Fabian, Alfie, and Peter said in unison.

"Does he say that all the time?" Skye asked.

"Yep." Nina, Amber, Patricia, Mira, and I said in unison.

"That gives me an idea. What if we kept Victor so awake, that when he falls asleep, nothing wakes him up, and we can get the amulets back?" Naomi asked.

"Wouldn't that rely on him actually being human?" Alfie asked.

"Yeah, okay, so we keep him up all night, and then when he does fall asleep…" Nina began.

"Nothing will wake him." Fabian said.

"And we get the amulets back." Naomi said.

"This is gonna be good." Alfie said.

"I'm actually kinda excited to get Victor ticked for once." Peter said while smiling.

"Alright, Amber, how would you keep Victor awake?" I asked her.

"I'd go down and trigger the security lights." Amber said.

"Then that's what we'll do. Let's go while Victor's out of his office." I said.

Once he had, and preoccupied himself with talking to Vera about something, Amber and I slipped outside, and triggered the security lights. Once we did, we hurried back inside so we wouldn't get caught by either Victor or Vera.

"Whoever is out here is in more trouble than they can possibly imagine!" Victor exclaimed.

"Point one, Sibuna." Amber and I said in unison.


Skye's POV


Alfie and I had snuck back into our room so Jerome wouldn't get suspicious about us missing or anything when he turned on the lamp in his room. What's he doing?

"Hey dude." Alfie said.

"What are you doing? Robbing a bank?" I asked.

"Not tonight. This is something else. Alfie? Skye? I could use your help." Jerome said.

"I dunno. We got a lot on tonight. What's your thing?" Alfie asked.

"Probably better than what we got." I admitted.

"I am going to break into the Frobisher Library and search for a long-lost gem in an ancient suit of armor." Jerome said.

"I'll admit, that sounds cool." I said.

"That sounds awesome! But what about the alarm?" Alfie asked.

Jerome held up a finger before he revealed the Frobisher Library key. Nice.

"Swiped it from Jasper's desk today. We don't have to worry about anything so long as we don't touch the exhibits." Jerome said.

"But what if the alarms do go off?" I asked.

"Victor would come running, right?" Alfie said.

"Potentially, yes, but-" Jerome began to say.

"We'll do it! Right?" Alfie asked as he was getting out of bed.

"Why not? It'll be fun." I said as I got out of mine.

"Thanks mates." Jerome said in surprise.


Mira's POV


Fabian, Nina, and I were hiding in the kitchen after Fabian stole Eddie's iPhone and hooked it up to various stereos around the living room. Once we were all hooked up, Fabian played one of Eddie's songs, and if this didn't get his attention, nothing would.

"Yes, yes, very clever! Now turn that racket off or there will be consequences! Who is it?! Well?! Show yourself!" Victor exclaimed after the song ended.

"Second verse, same as the first." Fabian said as he started the song from the beginning as I quietly laughed at our stay awake plan.

"What?! What is going on?! Who is it?!" Victor exclaimed.

"Point two, Sibuna." Nina and I whispered as we closed the doors to our hiding spot under the sink.


Peter's POV


I met up with Rufus in the clearing, with him clad in his usual clothes.

"What took you so long?" Rufus asked.

"Sorry, we were busying trying to keep Victor awake." I said.

"What? Are you insane?" Rufus asked me.

"You should really ask the person who raised me that question. Oh wait, that was you." I retorted.

Rufus opened his mouth to speak, but the paused in thought.

"Eh, fair point. Now, the maps." Rufus said as he held out a hand.

"I only got one so far. I didn't have a chance to get the other." I said as I got out the map to Mira's set of tunnels.

"This mark… the mark of Isis… oh, this brings back memories. Right, so at the end of these tunnels, will be the Necklace of Isis. And the Mask of Anubis?" Rufus asked me.

"Possibly at the end of the set of tunnels the Chosen One is searching." I said through gritted teeth.

"You've done well so far, Peter. But I'm warning you Peter. Do anything to alert your friends about me, or what I want, you know the price you will pay." Rufus said to me in warning.


Skye's POV


Getting into the library was easy. With Jerome here though, we would need to set off the alarms without him knowing.

"This is cool. It's like being a ninja. Ninja in the library. Book ninja. Sorry I'm returning these books late. Oh, it's okay. Now feel my steel!" Alfie exclaimed while swinging around his flashlight.

"Alfie! Concentrate." Jerome said.

"Right." Alfie and I said in unison as we kept looking for the suit of armor.

How in the world is it hard to even find a suit of armor in the first place? You'd think it would stick out like a sore thumb.

"I can't see a suit of armor anywhere. How about you two?" Jerome asked us.

"Nada." I said.

"Alfie!" Jerome exclaimed as Alfie was about to hit one of the display cases.

"Not yet." I mouthed to Alfie.

"Careful, those cases are alarmed." Jerome whispered.

"Nope. No armor here." Alfie said.

"You'd think it'd be easy to find." I said.

"Maybe it was moved. Or someone borrowed it." Alfie said.

"Why would someone borrow a suit of armor?" Jerome asked.

"I don't know. Coat rack maybe?" I asked.

"For a costume party, maybe? Or a war!" Alfie exclaimed.

"Admittedly, three very good reasons." Jerome said.

"How big is it?" Alfie asked.

"Seriously?" I asked.

"Man-sized, Alfie." Jerome said.

"Okay. So, that would be pretty easy to see, right?" Alfie asked.

"You'd think." Jerome and I said in unison.

"Let's just get out of here." Jerome said.

"You go on ahead. I'll be tying my shoelace." I said.

Once Jerome was out of the library, Alfie and I stood near two different display cases, shook them, and the alarms went off.

"Point three to Sibuna." Alfie said.

"Let's go." I said while laughing to myself.


Naomi's POV


I put the bucket loaded with old veggies, veggie scraps, and whatever other gross stuff I could find on top of Eddie's door. I switched places with Patricia as she knocked on the door.

"Eddie? Wakey, wakey." Patricia called out.

Once he opened the door, the bucket fell on top of him! I hid with Mara as he blindly moved around the hall and broke a glass vase. Uh-oh…

"What are earth is going on here?!" Victor exclaimed.

"Just… having a midnight snack." Patricia said.

"Detention. Detention for both of you. Commencing tomorrow and ending perhaps never. Now clear up this mess, and go to your rooms!" Victor exclaimed as Mara and I snuck our way back upstairs.

"What just happened?" Eddie asked Patricia.

"Long story short. Victor. You and me. Detention." Patricia said to Eddie.

Eddie said nothing as I heard him slap himself. Sorry Houston, this ain't a dream.

"I'm not dreaming. Great." Eddie said to himself.

"Point four, Sibuna." I said to myself.

We headed back into my room, slash Amber's room, slash Nina's room, and soon enough, Nina was back herself.

"Okay, so Victor's just gone back into his office looking pretty zombified. Now we just have to wait until he falls asleep, and then we make our move. But, in order to do that, we all have to stay awake. Okay?" Nina asked.

"We should do some things to keep our brains active. Like chess." Fabian said.

"Or exercise. That always keeps me awake." Mira said.

"Or we could tell spooky ghost stories." Alfie said in a creepy voice

"Oh, Alfie. Your stories are so boring." Patricia said.

"How about we count sheep to keep us awake?" Amber asked as we snickered a bit at her idea.

"Uh, Amber?" Peter began to say.

"Counting sheep does not keep you awake, Amber." Patricia said.

"Yeah, it usually does the opposite." Jade said.

"Oooohhhh. That's why it never worked." Amber said before she yawned.

"Snap out of it." Patricia scolded.

"Amber, no." Fabian and Peter said in unison.

"Fabian, Peter, we all need beauty sleep. Some of us more than others." Amber said as she looked at Patricia before turning back to face us.

"Hey! I saw that! I swear, if you fall a-" Patricia began to say before she yawned as well.

"Patricia, no!" Nina exclaimed.

"Don't…" Mira began to say as everyone else began to yawn as well.

"Not good." I said as Fabian, Nina, and Mira began yawning as well.

"Aren't you tired?" Peter asked me.

"I'm used to staying up at all kinds of odd hours. You guys can get some shut eye. I'll have first watch." I said.

We all ended up camping out in both our room and Mira's and Jade's room, sleeping bags and my extra blankets were laid out on the floor as I sketched out a room inspired by Ancient Egypt.

"Do you carry that everywhere?" Mira asked me tiredly.

"That's what my classmates at West Potomac High always asked me. It was a good place. Not a lot of love, but we had each other's backs. Crowding was a huge problem though. The math hallway was always so crowded. I had to get everything ready before leaving the classroom on the second floors or risk being late." I said as Mira laughed.

"I went to a private school on the West Coast. People who were my friends some were fake because they wanted to get close to Mira Summers, the best surfer in Ventura. I met Eddie when I was starting out. He and I used to be thick as thieves. Until I started gaining attention in the sporting world. I wonder what life would've been like if I never became a surfer." Mira said out loud.

"You'd probably be living a quiet life, and wouldn't have come here. As much as I like simplicity, this adventure, it's… pretty awesome. So, what's the deal with you and-" I started to say before Mira fell asleep.

Guess I better stay awake. I closed my eyes for a second, and when I opened them again, thirty minutes had passed! Oh man, I really dozed!

"Mira? I think Victor's asleep now." I said as I shook her awake.

"How long were you out?" Mira asked me.

"About thirty minutes. Let's go." I said in worry as we left her room.

We tiptoed over to the door when Nina and Fabian left Nina's room, and we all headed for Victor's office. He was out! Okay, good. We began sneaking in, but the door could've used some WD-40, and floorboards were creaking! At least he wasn't waking up. Yet. Thankfully he was wearing all nine of the amulets. Fabian pulled out a pair of scissors, and gave them to Nina as she began cutting the cord of the amulets. Just as she had cut them all off, Victor began to stir. Oh man. Not good…


To be continued! House of Curses will return soon! Until then, Sibuna! Please review.
