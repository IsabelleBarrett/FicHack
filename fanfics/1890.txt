And first off may I just say it was amazing (minus the pairings *cringes*) like I could actually see it happening in the series (again minus the pairings or else I will go on a rampage) but the pairings ended up being Laxus and Lucy *shudders* (no literally I felt nauseous and shivered when I typed that (I think I am actually allergic to any pairings other than Nalu (well not Gale or Gruvia or Jerza))) and then (must I say it) NaLi *shivers* I can't even. I think I am scarred for life. I can never unsee that fanfic. I ended up spending like six hours reading as many NaLu fanfics as I could. It was terrible. (no hate I am sorry to those who like NaLi) anyways the only thing I question is who sees Laxus and Lucy getting together? He never speaks to her and didn't even help during phantom lord. (have they ever communicated? Ever?) The other pairing I never really understood was Lucy and Jellal...it confuses the crap out of me. Does Jellal even acknowledge Lucy's existence? They have never talked so where do you see the chemistry? Jellal and Milliana have a better chance of getting together (but that won't happen because Jellal is Erza's! They are canon in my head) but if you can handle NaLi or ship them too or are indifferent (basically if you aren't like me) then I suggest you read it. It was really good. Its called "Sunlight, Let the Rays Light up Your Soul" and it was pretty good. Anyways I should just start the story. Lol I just can't go through one chapter without ranting. Oh well what are you gonna do? Enjoy!


Chapter 1

Natsu knew the moment he saw her that he had to have her. The way her golden hair fell just below her shoulders; looking like the bright sun. Her chocolate brown orbs that seemed to enchant anyone who looked straight into them and freeze time. He had heard of her before but had never seen her perform nor had he heard her sing. he watched as she walked on to the huge stage in a long, sparkling, white dress with her hair in a sock bun with two strands of hair hanging down on either of her face. She looked gorgeous. She sat down at the piano and prepared to play. The music started to play and Natsu watched with baited breath to listen to her voice.


I am done, smoking gun



We've lost it all, the love is gone



She has won, not it's no fun



We've lost it all, the love is gone



And we had magic, and this is tragic



You couldn't keep your hands to yourself



I feel like our world's been infected



And somehow you left me neglected



We've found our lives been changed



Babe, you lost me



And we tried, oh how we cried



We lost ourselves, the love has died



And though we tried, you can't deny



We're left as shells, we lost the fight



And we had magic, and this is tragic



You couldn't keep your hands to yourself



I feel like our world's been infected



And somehow you left me neglected



We've found our lives been changed



Babe, you lost me



Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet



But you chose lust when you deceived me



And you'll regret it, but it's too late



How can I ever trust you again?



I feel like our world's been infected



And somehow you left me neglected



We've found our lives been changed



Babe, you lost me


By the end of the song everyone had their mouths wide open at the talent of the beautiful girl on stage. she could feel the tears filling her eyes but refused to cry in front of her fans. She looked out over the crowd and saw how shocked everyone was. She usually sang happy and upbeat songs but had never been one for writing sad songs until recently. She smiled despite her tears and blushed. Suddenly everyone cheered and clapped, jumping up and down with faces of excitement and happiness. Lucy stood up and bowed before walking off stage.

As she walked off she noticed a guy from a band looking at her. She looked over at the pink-haired man as he smiled at her and gave her the thumbs up. She blushed an even darker red before ducking her head and going straight to her manager and walking to her dressing room in her tour bus parked outside of the stage. Her manager gave her a sad smile but didn't talk to her. She knew what Lucy wanted to do and she would respect her wishes.

Lucy ran into her dressing room and let the tears fall as she collapsed on the floor. She had felt so vulnerable on stage, opening up to all those people just like that right after what had happened. It was hard for her but it kind of helped her feel better in a way. It was a way for her to let her feelings out so they weren't all bottled up. She sat in the silence of her dressing room hearing the muffled sounds of cheers and music coming from outside her bus. Her thoughts suddenly traveled to the mysterious pink-haired boy who had given her the thumbs up. She knew who he was so he wasn't very mysterious but she had never met him.

His name was Natsu Dragneel, lead singer of the band Counting the Stars. His band consisted of him, Jellal the guitarist, Gray who plays the base, and Gajeel who plays the drums. She had heard some of their music and even enjoyed it and decided to go out and watch them perform. She wiped her tears and stood up quickly throwing on her change of clothes and walking outside to head back up to the stage. As she reached the stairs at the side of the stage she saw her manager standing by the side. She walked up to her and watched as the band she wanted to see set up on stage, "hey Mira," Mira looked over at the blonde startled before relaxing, "oh hey Lucy. I didn't hear you come up. How are you feeling?"

"Better. I wanted to see them perform so I decided to suck it up and come watch. Is Erza here?"

"Yeah. She saw you perform and wants to talk to you. Right now she is probably forcing her way to the front of the crowd. I told her she could watch on the side with us but she said it wasn't the same on the the side," Lucy sweat dropped at the thought of her red-haired friend pushing her way to the front of the stage. That could get violent quickly. Both girls however, went silent when the music started to play and Lucy found herself getting lost in the song.


Sometimes love's a scary place



It's like standing in the dark



Flying through the universe



Trying to fix your broken heart



It's okay to let it go



You don't have to be so brave



Take a chance if someone else



Is gonna sweep in and save the day



You don't have to face your fears alone



'Cause whenever you're in trouble



I'll know



Let me be your superhero



There isn't a place I won't go



Whenever you need me by your side



I'll be there, be there


Natsu looked over while singing and noticed the blonde standing off stage watching with a warm smile. He grinned at her and winked causing her to blush. He had seen how much pain she felt when she sang her song and it bothered him for some reason. he felt attracted to her and the feeling just seemed to grow stronger.


Never be afraid if you fall



I'll carry you away from it all



Let me be your superhero



Let me be your superhero



Take off your mask, put down your guard



Don't need a symbol on your chest



It's all right for once to play the damsel in distress



You're gonna use up all your strength



Trying to be so strong



Don't have to shoulder all the weight



Together we can take it on



You don't have to face your fears alone (you're not alone, baby)



'Cause whenever you're in trouble



I'll know, oh



Let me be your superhero



There isn't a place I won't go



Whenever you need me by your side



I'll be there, be there



Never be afraid if you fall



I'll carry you away from it all



Let me be your superhero



Let me be your superhero

Never be afraid if you fall

Let me be your superhero



Let me be your superhero



(Woah woah oooh)



Yeah, I can be your superhero



You know I will, baby



Woah woah woah oh oh



Let me be your superhero


As the song ended both Lucy and Mira clapped along with the crowd, satisfied with the song. The band members bowed before walking off the stage while their crew walked on to take off their instruments. Natsu walked up to Lucy and Mira smiling, "hey Mira, I didn't know you managed Lucy Heartfilia! You should have introduced us sooner," Mira smiled at him brightly, "oh Natsu you haven't changed a bit," they hugged as a confused Lucy stood between the two wondering how they knew each other, "wait how do you guys know each other?" Mira looked over at Lucy and giggled, "we went to the same high school," Lucy nodded and her gaze returned to the singer as he smirked at her, "you did great tonight Luce," as the nickname left his lips bad memories surfaced in Lucy's mind and her smile dropped,
that's what he called me
.

"uh...uh thanks. I need to go, see ya!" Lucy called before running for her tour bus as the tears resurfaced and flashbacks from that night started running through her head.

Natsu watched confusedly as the blonde ran away. He looked over at Mira with a questioning look as she smiled sheepishly at him, "Luce was the nickname her ex called her and she is really touchy on that kind of subject," Natsu nodded still looking off to where Lucy had run as if expecting her to come running back. She didn't, "well I should probably go check up on her but good job!" Natsu grinned and said, "I hope we see each other again soon!" Mira nodded before following after her blonde friend. Lucy closed and locked the bus door to make sure no one would follow her inside. She collapsed on her bed as the memories ran through her headâ€¦



~flashback~




It was a sunny morning in Magnolia as Lucy made her way to her boyfriend Sting's apartment. She had just been given the news that she would going on her first tour soon. A little over a year ago she had found and Mira and had asked her to manage her and help her with her singing career. Mira had agreed and they set to work to get the ambitious singer to the top. Her boyfriend knew how much she wanted to go on a tour, she felt like going on a tour would mean she made it to the "big league's" as she called it. She arrived at his apartment and skipped up the stairs practically jumping with excitement. She walked up to his door and reached under his mat for the spare key he always kept outside.



She put the key in the lock and turned it and opened the door. It was silent in the apartment and Lucy assumed Sting had been sleeping. She tip toed to his room trying not to wake the blonde. She opened the door and her heart dropped to her stomach. She was frozen in fear hoping and praying that this was all a dream and she wasn't really seeing this. In the bed was Sting and another girl. Both were naked and the girl was curled up next to Sting with her head on his chest. His arm was around her and lay on the curve of her hip.



Lucy couldn't stop the words that came out from her mouth, "Sting?" Blue eyes opened wide at the familiar voice as he took notice of his blonde girlfriend standing in his doorway looking absolutely broken, "Lucy," it was quiet but Lucy caught the whisper as their eyes locked. She tilted her head to the side still keeping control of the tears forming in her eyes, "why?" She whispered. Sting stayed silent for a minute not sure how to respond when he felt the girl beneath him squirm as she started to wake. The girl opened her eyes groggily and looked at Sting smiling, not noticing the heart broken blonde nor the horrified look in the blonde man's eyes, "good morning," she whispered as she stretched.



Brown and blue eyes shifted over to the white-haired girl waiting for her to catch on. Her eyes finally shifted over to the upset blonde and her eyes widened, "Sting?" She looked over at him and saw the pained look he had in his eyes. She looked back over the woman in front of her and saw the tears threatening to slip from her eyes. She put two and two together as she assessed the situation and her eyes widened to the size of saucers, "n-no" Sting sighed and put his head in his hands not sure what to do about the two girls staring at him expectantly.



Lucy watched as Sting put his head in his hands, "how could you?" Lucy choked out, "I trusted you. I loved you and this is what you do?" Sting looked up at her with wide eyes. He hadn't been expecting the sudden outburst but listened when she continued, "What were you thinking? Did it ever occur to you how I would feel if I found out? Of course not because you were only thinking about yourself. Does she know you have a girlfriend?" Lucy glanced over at the girl who had for the most part kept quiet, she was staring at the bed deep in thought. She looked up suddenly at the blonde with tears streaming down her cheeks, "I-I'm so sorry. I didn't know or I wouldn't have done this," Lucy looked at the girl and her expression softened at the sight of the white-haired girl in tears, "it's okay. I know you didn't. It's not your fault it's his. Why don't you get dressed and we can go get some breakfast," both Sting and the nameless girl's eyes widened at Lucy's invitation.



"Are you sure? A-After what just happened you want to-"



"What's the point of getting mad at someone who didn't know better? If you had known then yes I would be pissed but why put the blame on an innocent person?" Lucy interrupted.



"Oh! By the way my name is Lucy!" Lucy smiled at the girl.



"My name is Yukino," she smiled back at the blonde. Sting looked between the girls who had seemingly forgotten that he was even in the room. Lucy felt eyes on her and looked over at the man on the bed, "Yukino. Why don't you get dressed. I need to deal with him," Yukino's eyes widened at the feral look in Lucy's eyes and picked up her scattered clothes before scurrying into the bathroom to change. Both male and female watched as the girl ran to the bathroom to change.



Lucy fixed her gaze back on to the man and she gave him a sharp glare as anger coursed through her veins giving her a boost of adrenaline. She stomped over to him and leaned over the man sitting on the bed as he leaned back. She could read him like a book and she knew that he was intimidated by her, "why would you do this? How could you?" Sting flinched at the poisonous tone she was using, "I-I don't know?" Sting looked into her eyes and was instantly frozen in fear at the murderous glare the blonde gave him, "wrong answer." She growled.



"Look. I couldn't take it. You wouldn't let me do barely anything with you and I couldn't handle it." The look she gave him made him realize that that wasn't the best answer.



"So you screwed the first girl you met?"



"Please calm down. I'm sorry."



"CALM DOWN?! YOU'RE SORRY?!" She screamed, "WHY THE HELL SHOULD I CALM DOWN WHEN MY BOYFRIEND JUST CHEATED ON ME?! YOU REALLY THINK SORRY IS GONNA CUT IT? YOU'RE FUNNY!"



"no but-"



"NO! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR BULLSHIT!" Both heard the click of a door and shifted their gaze over to Yukino who had just walked out of the bathroom dressed. Lucy calmed herself down and stood up straight. She gave a strained smile to the terrified girl and walked over to her, "ready?" Yukino nodded, not trusting her voice, "okay let's go," Lucy linked her arm with Yukino's and both started walking out of the room. Lucy stopped suddenly and turned to look at Sting, "oh I almost forgot to tell you. We are over. I don't want to see you, hear you, or talk to you so if you know what's good for you, stay away," with that both walked out. They ended up going to a cafe and both had a really good time. Lucy had gone home and locked herself in her room and cried for hours on end.




~flashback end~




Do you like it? I like it(: haha anyways tell me how I am doing! btw, Yukino's hair is white right? I should have looked it up. Lol I looked up Sting's eye color because I honestly had no idea and I hate when other people get a character's characteristics wrong. Do you know how many fanfictions I have read where they describe Natsu's hair as red?! NO! Red is Erza's hair! Red is the color of your blood when I cut you so you know what red looks like! If Mashima wanted natsu's hair red then he would make it a lot darkerâ€¦.ugh it gets me so mad and then I spend like five minutes thinking about what Natsu would look like with red hair. It's pink or salmon and it's so painfully obvious I don't know how you could call that red. I don't go around calling Erza's year pink, or Meredy's hair red (dude! Meredy has darker hair than Natsu)! I also have a problem with people spelling the characters names wrong. Like the most common are Gazille and Gerrard. I get so confused, like it's Gajeel. It's Jellal. DO you watch Fairy Tail? I just don't know...anyways I have a problem. I have been having writer's block with "Missing You" I am very sorry for the inconvenience but holy Mavis I can't think of anything and it's making me so mad! I know what to do I just don't know how to put it and I am just struggling hardcore...anyways see you all next chapter and Missing you's next chapter may take a while. hey I started it lol thats an improvementâ€¦.I think (jk I only have like four sentences...
