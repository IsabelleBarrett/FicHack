I thought that some of you didn't notice, but it is called Addict - Nothing Left. So, check it out of you want to know what happened if Magnus wasn't there to help Alec. I just really wanted to write about those two again, since they are so damn adorable. :3 So, anyway, I hope you read the other fic, and that you don't dislike it, since there is some self harm in it. Enjoy! -KaZeMix
