Trent walked into the Main Lodge for breakfast and most of the other Gophers applauded him. He smiled but laid his head on the table as soon as he sat down. He wasn't alone. Duncan and a few others laid with their heads on the tables. Anne Maria walked up to Duncan looking annoyed. "Hey, just be glad we didn't have Staci chattin' up the place last night!" Most of the Bass nodded in agreement.

Chris came into the room clapping to get everyone's attention. "Okay campers, listen up! Your next challenge begins in ten minutes. And be prepared to bring it!"


The campers were next seen in a boxed in gymnasium on the beach, bordered off by glass walls. Trent was dozing off on one of the benches in the back of the room until Chef blew a whistle in his face and walked across the room, stealing glances at each of the contestants. Chris then picked up a red ball and explained the challenge. "Today's challenge is the classic game of dodgeball. If you get hit with the ball, you're out." He then tossed the ball at Dakota who screamed and ducked before getting hit, holding her hands above her head as she prepared to yell. Chris ignored her and continued. "If you catch the ball, the thrower gets sent out of the game and the catcher can bring back another team member out on the court. If you're holding a ball, you can use it to deflect a ball. But, if it knocks the ball out of your hands, you're out!"


The teams then separated to decide who would play first. Heather seemed to take the leadership position for the Gophers. "Okay, Trent can sit out since he's practically useless like this." She then pointed over to Trent who was drooling on the bleachers again. "So, who's going out first?" Katie and Sadie both raised their hands. "Okay fine, I'll go and you two can go. We need some more strength out there because the Bass will be trying extra hard to win this one, so i was thinking Eva and DJ."They both nodded, Eva without any expression or thought at all.


Zoey was the first to volunteer for the Bass. "I'll go first!"



Zoey: I keep losing challenges for my team. I have to prove I'm worth keeping or I'm sure to go next.



Bridgette nodded. "Okay, I'll go too. Who else? Duncan is exhausted so he can sit this one out."

Brick raised his hand. "I'll go. I'm quite good at games like this."

Beth joined in too. "I guess I'll go now too."

Bridgette smiled. "Great, we need one more. Cameron?"

Cameron shrugged. "I guess if I have to…"


The teams lined up to begin the match. Chris stood behind the court after laying out three balls on either side. "Alright, let's dodge some ball!" With that, Chef blew his whistle from the high chair, thus beginning the game.

Eva was the first to grab a ball and throw it directly at Zoey who immediately gasped and ducked out of the way. Zoey looked back at Eva and made a grab for a ball on her side. She stood and threw the ball at the other side of the court, hitting Heather. As Heather walked off the court, Brick threw a ball at Sadie. Sadie just gasped and protected her face but Katie ran and caught the ball before it could hit her best friend. Brick hung his head as he walked off the court and Trent yawned before walking out onto the threw a ball at Katie who then moved out of the way, causing the ball to hit Trent as he walked onto the court.

DJ threw a ball at Cameron that knocked him all the way against the wall. DJ winced. "Ooh…sorry about that." But as he was apologizing, Beth threw a ball that put DJ out of the game.

Eva deflected a ball from from Bridgette with the ball in her hands before throwing it and putting Bridgette on the bench. Zoey threw her ball as soon as Bridgette was hit, putting Eva out of the game. Eva growled at Zoey as she walked off the court. Zoey ignored her and picked up another ball, throwing it and putting Sadie out of the game, leaving only Katie playing for the Gophers.

Beth and Zoey waited on their side of the court because all of the balls were on the Gopher's side. Katie walked up to the nearest ball, pick it up and threw it at Zoey. As it hit, it bounced directly off of Zoey and into Beth's stomach. Chef blew the whistle and Chris walked onto the court and gestured toward Katie. "And Katie wins this round for the Gophers!" The rest of the Gophers cheered as Katie walked back to them.



Katie: Turns out I'm really good at dodgeball. Who knew?




Sadie: Katie came in here without me! I think this new dodgeball skill of hers is starting to get to her head. She's only been good at it for a few minutes and she's already abandoning me!



The Bass began to put their next group together. Brick was the first to suggest any names. "Zoey, you were really good in that last round. You should definitely go again."



Zoey: Yes! They want me to play! They don't hate me anymore!



Alejandro volunteered, raising his hand. "I suppose it's my turn now."

Zoey walked over to the members of her team sitting on the bench. "Anne Maria, Owen? Are you guys ready?"

Owen raised his arms in the air. "Heck yeah!"

Anne Maria was less enthusiastic. "What about him?" She gestured toward Duncan. "He hasn't played yet either."

Zoey put her hand to her face in thought. "I guess he needs to take his turn just like the rest of us." She shrugged and walked over to him. The red-head began to nudge Duncan's arm, showing no fear. The rest of her team cowered behind her.

Duncan stood up but showed how annoyed he was. "You'd better have a good reason for waking me."

Zoey put her hands on her hips to show she wasn't afraid. "It's your turn to play."

"Oh yeah, who put you in charge? Last time I checked, you haven't exactly held your own in this competition anyways."

"Hey! I have been doing everything that I could. And if you don't get into this game, then I can't really say the same about you!"

"So what. Unlike you, I really couldn't care less what these guys think of me." Duncan folded his arms.

Zoey finally looked hurt. "Ugh…fine. Don't play then. Brick, are you up for another round?" Brick nodded, giving Zoey a sympathetic look. "Okay, let's go then."


Tyler opened up the discussion for the gophers. "I think I should get a turn now. I'm wicked good at these games."

Heather scoffed. "Okay fine. Who else?"

Scott pitched in. "Why don't you give the rest of us a chance?" He gestured toward himself, Harold, Dakota, and Lindsay.

"Fine, don't screw this up!" Heather put her finger in Scott's face but Scott just folded his arms and walked onto the court.


Chef blew the whistle and Zoey was the first to grab a ball. She threw it and immediately hit Lindsay, who fell to the ground. Tyler threw the next ball but Owen deflected it with another, causing it to hit was looking at her own reflection in the glass wall when she was hit with a ball. Harold dodged a ball but was then hit by another.

Tyler stood alone on his side of the court as all five Bass members threw their balls at the same time, instantly putting Tyler out of the game.

Heather walked up to Scott. "Great suggestion. If we lose, you are so going home." She walked away and Scott rolled his eyes.



Scott: Heather's vicious and everybody knows it. *Sighs* But she does have some dirt on me now. I need my own alliance to counter hers. But who's worth my time?



Katie made a suggestion to her team. "I don't mean to sound conceited but I feel like I'm actually really good at this game. Can I go again?"

Heather smiled and nodded. "Of course."

Sadie raised her hand. "Ooh! Me too."

Katie cautiously put her opinion into the matter. "Um…Sadie? No offense but I don't really feel like dodgeball is your forte."

Heather nodded. "Agreed." Sadie hung her head "Now, Katie, Eva, and DJ. You guys are our best players so you should go again. Who else?"

Scott ran up to Heather. "Give me another chance!" He leaned in to whisper to Heather. "That last group I was in was just a bunch of chumps."

"Fine. We need one more. Tyler? Wanna give it another go?" Tyler nodded and ran out to the court.



Scott: So it looks like Sadie and Katie are having some issues. They're already super needy. Either one of them would be easy to fool into an alliance. But Katie's proven herself to be an actual threat today. So It's best if I get rid of her before I have to compete with her.



Alejandro put his arm around Owen as they walked back to the benches. "Owen, you were magnificent out there. I think you should go back out there."

Zoey walked up to them. "I agree. I was thinking Bridgette, Alejandro, Anne Maria, Owen, and I for the next round. Any objections?"

Beth raised her hand. "Zoey? I think you should sit this one out…Give some of us another chance?"

Zoey gasped. "Oh Beth, I'm so sorry! If you want to go, then be my guest. I'll sit this one out." Beth smiled at her and walked onto the court with the others.


When Chef blew the whistle, starting the third match, Katie made the first move, picking up two of the balls on her side and immediately taking out Bridgette and Anne Maria. Owen reacted by picking up the two nearest balls and putting Tyler and DJ out of the game. Eva threw Alejandro out of the game but was hit by another throw from Owen. Beth threw a ball at Scott but Katie stepped in and caught it without giving Scott a chance. Beth hung her head as she walked off the court. As she came up to the rest of her team she said, "Sorry Zoey."

Zoey gave a weak smile. "It's fine Beth. We're all doing our best." Beth sat down and put her head in her hands.

Sadie came out onto the court when Katie caught the ball but Owen immediately threw her out. Right after that, Katie threw out Owen, ending the match.


Zoey got up to address her team. "Okay guys. We can't lose anymore or we lose this challenge. Now, it looks like Owen is our best player. So Owen, are you okay to go again?"

Owen opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by Duncan. "Look, Owen's good but he's not enough to win this."

Zoey crossed her arms. "Okay, I thought you were napping. You obviously don't care about this game so why should we listen to you?"

"Look, I was watching you guys out there. We have some decent players but there's just no strategy out there."

"Oh, and you have a strategy?"

"Yes, I do. Let me play this round."

"Why do you care all of a sudden?"

"To be honest, I get the feeling I'm not too safe if we lose."

Zoey thought for a second. "Okay, you can play. Now what's your strategy?"


The Gophers spent hardly any time deciding on their next team. "Okay, we just need to win one more time. So Katie, Eva, DJ, Harold, and I should go next." Heather pointed at each of them as she said their names. "Any objections." Nobody spoke up. "Okay, let's go."



Katie: I'm so glad my team actually finds me useful now!



Chef blew the whistle and all of the Bass picked up a ball and threw it at Eva. They continued the strategy, throwing all of their balls at the same player at once. As they picked off the Gophers one by one, Scott approached Sadie on the sidelines. "Hey Sadie, looks like your Katie's found her place on the team, huh?"

"Yeah…so?"

"Well, where does that leave you? I mean, Katie's moved on. You can't depend on her anymore."

"I do not lean on Katie!"

"Let's be honest Sadie, you do. But, I don't think you have to. What if you and I form a secret alliance? We'll vote together and you'll have more power than Katie on this team finally."

Sadie looked as though she were seriously considering this. "Okay…so if I did join, who would we vote out first?"

Scott smiled since he could tell Sadie was interested. "Well, we need to get rid of the strongest players so we don't have any competition later."

"Who's that?"

"It's not important now. We'll decide that if and when we lose. Are you in?"

Sadie looked at Katie out on the court. Katie was dodging the Bass's attacks unlike the rest of her team. Sadie nodded. "Okay, I'm in."


Eventually, Katie was hit and Chef blew the whistle. Heather turned to Katie when she got back to the bench. "Are you okay to play again? You're the best player here and Duncan's strategy is going to be tough to beat." Katie nodded. "Okay, good. Scott, Trent, Eva, and DJ? We need our dream team now or we lose." They all silently agreed.

The Bass took out the same team and planned to use the same strategy. When Chef blew the whistle, Duncan led the first attack which put DJ out of the game. Katie managed to throw Brick out but Duncan's next attack put Katie out of the game.

On the sidelines, Heather face palmed when she realized their chances of winning were over. One by one, The Bass took Eva, Scott, and Trent out of the game.

Chris walked over to the Bass. "And finally, the Killer Bass win!" The Bass members cheered.



Duncan: See? I know what I'm doing.




Zoey: Okay, I admit it. We would've lost without Duncan.



Inside the Gopher cabin, Heather was going through her things as she spoke to Lindsay. "This is the first time we've had to vote someone out. We need to pick wisely. I'm going to go take a shower before the ceremony." She walked up to Lindsay and put her finger in the blonde girl's face. "Go tell Harold that we're voting for Scott tonight, okay? Don't screw this up." Lindsay nodded and Heather walked out of the cabin and passed Scott—who was listening outside the door—without noticing him.

When Lindsay walked out of the cabin, Scott stopped her. "Hey, Lindsay! What are you up to?"

"Not now Skip. I have to go tell Harold something."

"Oh? What's that?"

"Oh no, I can't tell you any more about Heather's alliance!"

"I never asked you to. I just wanted to know how you were doing."

"Oh…Well I have important business to attend to." Lindsay began to walk away but then stopped. "Wait…what was I doing?"

Scott smirked. "You were about to tell Harold to vote for Katie."

"Oh that's right! Thanks Skip!" Lindsay walked away after waving to Scott.



Scott: Sadie was tough to convince but that's to be expected. Lindsay on the other hand is so easy to manipulate, it almost isn't fun.



Chris stood behind his podium at the bonfire holding a tray of marshmallows. "Gophers. I have ten marshmallows here. When I call your name, come and get one. The camper that does not get a marshmallow must take a walk down the dock of shame and catch a ride on the boat of losers. Oh! And you can't come back…Ever!" Heather roller her eyes. "Now, the marshmallows go to…

Scott! Sorry Katie, but you're out!"

Katie was obviously shocked. "But…I'm actually useful to the team now! Why did you guys vote for me?" Nobody answered but Heather was growling under her breath. Katie sighed and hung her head as she walked to the dock. "Bye Sadie! Win for me!" Sadie looked away so she wouldn't show Katie how upset she was but Katie thought she was mad. Katie started to cry as she ran down the dock and went home.


"Well that certainly was the most dramatic bonfire ceremony yet! Now that Zoey's beaten her losing streak, how long with her winning streak last? Will Scott's new alliance beat out Heather's? Will Zoey and Duncan finally get along? And will Sadie survive without Katie here? Find all this out and more on the next episode of Total Drama Island!"



A/N I feel like this is my best chapter yet. But of course, my opinion doesn't mean much without input from readers. So please give me your thoughts. But this was definitely the most fun chapter to write yet. I have big plans from here on out so it's only going to get better. Thank you for reading!
