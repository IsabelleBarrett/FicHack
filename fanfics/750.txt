" Ve! Romano!" The Italy ran to his brother " You are awake!"

" Grrr get off me!" Romano shoved him into Germany " Potato bastard get off my brother! And..what is going on?!"

Britain looked at the southern Italian " Looks like we have been kidnapped."

America laughed " Hahahahahahah! Dude! This totally sucks!"

France grinned " Look at all these lovely speci/mens/ "he winked, making a few gag.

Spain went over to Romano " Roma!" He handed him a tomato " For you."

Romano was about to reply when a loud sound was heard around the room. Smoke came from the side and someone came out, smiling wide.

" Ve! Grandpa Rome!" He jumped up, running to the young grandfather. " What are you doing here! Fratello look!"

Rome smiled and ruffled Italy's hair " Im here to make you guys do dares and admit embarrassing stuff! So tell the readers to review all their truths and dares!"

" Ve! What he said!" Italy yelled, not thinking about it.

" No!" All the nations yelled. But nothing could be done. It's been finalized.

" Stupid Fratello!" Romano yelled, shaking his brother by his shirt.

" Mi dispaice Mi dispaice Mi dispaice!" Italy yelled.

Germany sighed " Well...I guess we need to play this game now...so review? I guess."
