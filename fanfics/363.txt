But aside my pro baller status, I'm here to tell y'all about Teammates Forever. Now months ago after announcing I'm playing pro ball, I said basketball would not slow me down on doing this story. Well ...I was wrong; it actually did, plus for me being lazy to do it.

However, I have this to say... The chapters that you have previously read or currently reading, will be re-edit. Being humbled of this, I criticized my own writing and grammar mistakes.

And as I mentioned of me re-editing the story, I WON'T delete the story then re-publish it. I'm gonna keep it as it is.

That's all I got for you guys today. Take care.
