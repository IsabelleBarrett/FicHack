Hello Everyone! I haven't written a fanfic in a long time so I'm a little out of My Author's Note Part. I do have to say for this story in particular I was very inspired to do a Doumeki/Oc because I simply cannot find any completed ones out there! I spent weeks upon weeks writing this story in my head and I feel now I should write it and share it out. I hope I will be able to upload at LEAST 1 chapter every two days, as I want to proofread them and edit them so you receive the maximum reading experience. I tried to break out of the box a little so at times the characters may seem slightly to very OOC. I promise to work hard on this story, and I sincerely hope you will all find the time to drop a review for me, I want to know what you honestly think.


Disclaimer: I own nothing of xxxHolic except for this story. Owning this wonderful anime and manga is allwonderful CLAMP's doing.

He hoped to God this wasn't happening again.

"
Ahahahaha! Shi-chan, betcha you can't catch me!"


Long white tresses pulled up into pigtails cover the young girls face except for her bright cheery smile.

"
Shi-chan let's go to the festival tonight!"


Her bright pink yukata decorated with sakura blossoms swished in the evening air. The glare of a nearby lantern whited her face out.

"
Shi-chan, hurry up, we'll be late for school!"


She was running in front of him, her skirt swishing from the rapid pace, her schoolbag swinging beside her.

"
Hey...Shi...chan..."


Her long white dress. Cream colored sandals. Floppy white hat. Crystal tears running down her face.

"
I'm leaving. Sayonara Shi-chan..."


Always the same dream. Always the same nightmare.

Always.
