So, I have decided to start my very first Hostage Fanfic! This is kind of different than the normal writing that I do, but nonetheless, I believe it will still be good. If you enjoy this, please let me know. Throughout the story, I will shift back and forth between Duncan and Ellen's POV's and it'll be in third person instead of first.





This story contains: humour, romance, betrayal, violence, drama, and murder.





All or most of the characters from Hostages will be in the story along with some OCs to help prolong the story along.





I hope you enjoy this story, as much as I have when I wrote it. And please leave reviews, and if it sucks, let me know, that way I can improve coming chapters.
