Third POV


All the way to the living room, Bruce was tense and Dick had a dazed look on his face. The tension was still pretty high when they reached the living room. Everyone sat done except Danny and Alfred went to go get the first aid kit.

"Let's start this off by what the heck was THAT?" Bruce yelled/asked

"That was a ghost" Danny said with a blank expression.

"And why was it attacking you?" Bruce asked.

At this question Danny started to look sheepish and Alfred comes back with the first aid kit.

"Master Daniel, I need you to take off your shirt to get to your other wounds," Alfred told Danny.

"Okay," Danny said kind of cautious and took off his shirt. There covering Danny's whole chest were scars, mostly bladed and burned, that criss cross over each other. Alfred starts taking the glass out of the cuts from the fight.

"The ghost was targeting me because I was the weakest out of the family and that I was the only prey that got away from that particular ghost. Before you ask my family is a bunch of ghost hunters that made a freaking portal in our basement." Danny said.


Bruce's POV


What Danny said in his room come rushing back to me in a blur. The enemies that want him dead are ghost that want revenge, revenge for what I don't know. I will have to ask Danny about it later. You can't you arrest something that's dead it will just get out and from the scars that are on Danny's chest said that he had to learn how to fight and quickly at that or he would have died. The silence and my thoughts were broken by a familiar ring tone. I groaned thinking what could
they
possibly want now. I picked up the phone and answer.

"What do you want
Wally
?" I asked
