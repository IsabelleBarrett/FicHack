"I'm hopelessly lost..." Arlon muttered to himself, "Wait, what's that?" There was a very strange structure in the distance. When Arlon got closer to it, all he could say was, "What?" There was a stone structure with an iron frame, it seemed like some sort of gateway. Then he saw the 4 stone pillars beside it. Each one had a different colored stone on top of it, except for the last one, which seemed like it was missing. Instantly, Arlon reached into his pocket and took out the green stone, then he thought 'How am i going to get up there?' It was about twice his size. Then he remembered the sword.

Then, Arlon stuck it in the ground. Using the sword as a platform, he jumped and placed the stone atop the last pillar. When he took the sword out of the ground, the gateway seemed to emit a strange sound. Then it started sucking Arlon in. Arlon resisted, but the suck got stronger. It lifted him off his feet and through the gateway. He started to say "Don't!" but it was too late. he had passed through the gateway. "Just Great." Said Arlon. "Why does everything happen to me? Now where am I? No... Everythings going dark..." then Arlon blacked out.
