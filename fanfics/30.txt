Today we see our wonderful hero Ash Katchum and his friends beside him. The lovely Dawn Berlitz(ash's girlfriend)and the intelligent brock. Ash has just defeated the sinnoh league and became a Pokémon master. This has always been his dream besides meeting the girl of his dreams and completing the pokedex. Our heroes have just arrived in the beautiful town of pallet where ash lives. His mom heard of his accomplishment and decided to throw him a party and invited all his friends from the new to the old ones. Hours have past and everyone has left except dawn. Ash wanted to tell her something very important so important that it will change everything. Ash has taken Dawn to a nearby lake. Ash was talking to dawn until there was a brief moment of silence. Ash then broke it by saying to dawn "Dawn Berlitz I love you and I want to spend all my life with you, will you marry me". Dawn then said screaming out "yes, yes Ash Ketchum I will". Then next week we will have our wedding.

Three days pass

May, Max and misty have decided to come over and see what's going between ash and dawn. May asked dawn "so when is the wedding" then dawn answered " two days from now". They decided to go outside where max and ash where having a battle. The battle was intense ash's Pikachu against max taillow. In a few minutes the match ended and ash as victorious.

Two days pass

Ash was all ready to get marry to his future wife. He was daydreaming on how will dawn look in her outfit. Then the wedding started to begin and ash still day dreaming .Then out of nowhere she came out with a white dress and it began.

So how was it good huh next time 10 years pass and ash and dawn have a kid named Jason and he starts his pokemon adventure just like his father did before him
