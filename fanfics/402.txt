Run. Run as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. I thought as I ran through the forest, following the familiar trail. Running was my life. It's all I did. It helped, taking me from my problems. I stopped at the fork in the road, like I always did. I looked between the two patches.

One was lush and green with bright colorful foliage. The other was gray and bare with tree that knotted around each other. I always picked the green path, enjoying the butterflies and deer that were scattered throughout. But, the gray path...

It had often sparked my curiosity. Of course, there were rumors about this path. Rumors about murder and demons and witchcraft. I often brushed them off as old lady supersitution. But, the more I looked at the cursed path, it was easy to believe that the rumors were true.

My iPod beeped, snapping me from my thoughts. I cursed under my breath and ran down the green path. I was going to be late for the first day of school.
