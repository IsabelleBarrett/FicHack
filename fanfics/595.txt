I might put it up for adoption or I might delete it. I'm so sorry but my inspiration for this story has just completely left me. My heart has been stolen by Supernatural and two certain Winchester boys. I know this might be a disappointment to some of you, lord knows I hate it when a story I'm following gets abandoned. I normally don't abandon stories because usually I have finished them before I post anywhere but this one I decided to try making it up as I went. That didn't turn out so well and I apologize for that. I will probably start writing new ones soon. I'm thinking of doing a Supernatural and Harry Potter crossover among other things. If I do write another story rest assured I will make sure it's finished before I post anything. I will not be making this mistake again.



Sorry to disappoint

(Please review and tell me what your opinion is. If enough of you really want me to continue this story I just might be able to. But it will be a while because I will make sure I have finished it before I post anything else.)
