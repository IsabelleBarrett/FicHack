The forest is so dark, the moonlight being the only light at all. I'm so tired and cold...I still can't remember how I got lost in this forest. My whole body feels weak, I collapse near a tree stump. I can feel the coldness in my body rising, my vision fades as I begin to see the trees move around me and then...darkness...

I open my eyes again and my body feels light, except for my head. It's like I'm wearing some sort of wooden mask. I look around and the trees start to move again and I see piercing red eyes before me. They all crawl towards me as I shake in fear.

"Please, don't hurt me!" I cry out as one of them slowly moves closer to me. The tree then speaks and for once, I can understand what it says. Reaching a branch-like arm to me, it says: "Do not worry, young one. We care for our own."

I do not understand until it takes me to the nearby river so I can see my reflection. My eyes are now the same piercing red as the trees around me, my body a dark, transparent form and a wooden mask on my face, resembling a tree trunk. I look up at the tree and it seems to smile down at me. It's hand takes mine and we walk deeper into the dark forest.

"Welcome to your new home."
