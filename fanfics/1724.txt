JUST A QUICK AUTHOR'S NOTE ~


Thank you all for your reviews! Critical too! =) I appreciate all of them! I promise I have not abandoned this story! I've just been busy writing some short stories on the side – which you can find on /~annikamw if you're interested in reading those. Once I finish my short story series I will return to Thranduil and Ylva!

As for the anonymous review on the Elvish languages, thank you for that one too. I wasn't too sure about that. I have also been rewriting the earlier chapters and working on Ylva's character and behavior – and also Thranduil's.
