Summary:

Homura observes all other possibilities with her new powers. And Madoka just wants cake.



After the [Demon] ascended (or descended) to a higher plane of existence, outside the existence of a linear time, she'd finally been able to observe all possible outcomes of the multiverse. Of course, [Deviations] still occurred, but she has contingency plans for these things in the case that these [Deviations] would overlap with her best friend.

Many a universes, the Demon observed, were filled with timelines where the race of the Incubators were subjugated by other races. In one, the Chitauri conquered the race with the help of an Eternal; in another universe, the race was obliterated by the Kree after winning their Kree-Skrull war; another by Cephalopods with superior technology; another too by the Skrull when they had won the Kree-Skrull war. Shuma-gorath faced against the Incubator race as well and defeated it. Dormammu tried too and prevailed.

Many universes also had the Incubators obliterated by other stronger forces. The [Devourer of Worlds] once stumbled upon the Incubator's planet and consumed it within five hours. A darkened [Force of the Phoenix]'s host, in another universe, destroyed the race with a blink of it's eye because the Incubators tried to study it. In another, a meteor collided with the planet just when their race was beginning to show technological progress.

The [Demon] that is Homura Akemi found out in the timelines and universes where the Incubators were no more that their universe ended just a little bit (and only so because she is no longer linear) earlier than that where the Incubators prevailed and exploited other planets.

The [End] was inevitable, of course, but she's got more important matters to attend to, mainly keeping the [Goddess] suppressed so her best friend could be happy.

The [Mermaid] tried to help the [Goddess], plotted to free her to an existence of selflessness and obscurity, and one time, the [Mermaid] was able to get the help of the [Red Wudan] and the [Adorning Yellow]. But Homura has seen most, if not all, of the possible outcomes and Sayaka's plan had been thwarted time and time again. If Madoka's old memories didn't have strong attachments to the [Mermaid], then Homura would've banished her just like Kyoko Sakura and Mami Tomoe in other universes.

Speaking of Kyoko and Mami, the [Demon] looked over to where she'd banished the two. Mami was in a timeline where her powers were sealed because the Earth of her prison was so ordinary, magic was literally just a figment of imagination. Kyoko was on a timeline where the currently un-subjugated Incubator race was exploiting the savagery of the races of the Skrull and Kree, ensuring that the planet Earth was free from its paws. Surprisingly, Yuma Chitose (probably due to the nature of her [Wish]) ended up getting dragged with her.

"Homura-chan..." Homura looked over to her side, and saw Madoka looking at her, "Aren't you gonna eat that?" The imprisoned [Goddess] pointed at her friend's unfinished slice of chocolate cake.

The [Demon] smiled at her beloved best friend, "Let's share mine." In turn, Madoka giggled and stabbed the treat with her fork.
