Daya looks at him and another scream came out from his mouth…


Daya (
shockingly):
Abhijeet tum?

Abhijeet (
moving towards him):
Haan main..main he honga naa..mera gher hai tu main tu yahen honga naa…


Daya embarrassed so he lower down his gaze…he was so so confused abt his presence…after few seconds he looks towards him and asked in low tone..while pressing his head continually..


Daya: wo ..main ..main yahen kasa?Ahhh ..mera sar…


Abhijeet sat down on bed in front of him..Daya was more n more shocked after seeing Abhijeet behaving wd him like this…


Abhijeet: Tuma yahen main laa aya…

Daya (
confused bt loud):
Tum ?

Abhijeet(
little angry tone)
: haan main.. aur kon laya ga tuma? Hai koi? (
Daya looks downward)
bas decision liya aur bag door para…iss sa tumara yah demag badal jata hai..duniya nai..wo wasa ki wasi he rahti hai..smjha.. (
calms down a bit)
sharab ka nasha main para tha tum wahen uss green club mein…ager main nai jata tu?

Daya (
shocked):
kye maine sharab pee? Aur main wahen kasa ponch gaya?

Abhijeet (
concern):
Daya? Tuma kuch bhi yaad nai kye?


Daya nodded his head as Big No…. And Abhijeet makes the sad face…Daya looks at him confusingly… Abhijeet went outside and came back wd tablets and water glass and gave him as..


Abhijeet: lo yah tablets laa lo..iss sa tumara dard kam ho jaya ga…
Daya looks at him confusingly and then took that tablets quietly….


Daya: Abhijeet…kye hua kal ?main tuma wahen kasa mila? Aur tum wahen kasa?


Abhijeet thinks for few seconds and then sat beside him and console him as…


Abhijeet: tuma dondta donta wahen pooncha main.(
sad tone)
tuma bht dant diya kal tu tumari fikar ho rai thi..(
Daya was looking downward)
Raj na help ki meri.. (
Daya looks at him)
aur jab wahen main gaya tu tum sharab ka nasaha mein tha….

Daya (
scarly):
Aur pher?


After seeing Daya scared face..Abhijeet unexpectedly smiles and replies him after rubbing his hairs as..


Abhijeet (
smiling):
Aur pher yah mera bhai ka tu na uss nasha mein wo sab kah diya mujh saa..jo tu yun hosh mein kabhi nai khata…


Daya looks at him with embarresemnt..tears came in his eyes… he looks at Abhijeet…


Daya: Sab kuch?

Abhijeet (
sadly):
haan sab kuch…


And with this Daya hugs him tightly suddenly…and starts crying loudly….Abhijeet too hugs him tightly and allows him to showed his pain..which is locked in him..Daya was crying loudly... really really heart broken..


Daya (
crying):
I m sorry Abhi… I m so sorry… yar mera pas words he nahin hain apni galti ki mahfi mangna ka..per tumara dil tu bht bara haina… yar tum muja chor ka mat jana..main tu chala gaya tha..per main kabhi yah bardasht nai kar payon ga ka tum muja chor do..plz Abhi..plz yar mahf kar do..i m very sorry..yar wo… tumara dost..wo.. anty..wo sab log..yar main..i m very sorry yar..plz muja mahf kar do..tum muja mahf kar do ga naa? main buht dar gaya tha tumara wo sab khana ka bad...yaar tum kabhi wasa mat karna..plz ...Abhi tum muja chor ka mat jana... plz yar..main nai rah sakta..tuma muja chor ka tu nai jayo ga naa? (
Scarly)
Abhi?


Abhijeet pulls him back..cupped his face in his hands and after removing his tears..speak as..


Abhijeet: bas Daya..bas.. buht ho gaya rona dona..aga he sar main dard haina tera…

Daya (
teary tone):
Abhijeet…humara rishta

Abhijeet (
cutting him):
Saf ho gaya Daya.. (
Daya looks at him shockingly)
jasa barish main dhul kar har cheez saf ho jati haina….bilkul clear.. wasa he humara rishta bhi yah sab dard takleef jhel ka bilkul clear ho gya hai.. Sahi meanings humara rishta ka abi tu smaj ayen hain huma..(
tears falls down from Daya's eyes)
aik dosra ki Importance..need..feel..yah sab ab hi tu smjh ayi haina huma… sab sa bar ka aik baat ka hum aik dorsra ka bina adhore hain..nai rah sakta aik dosra ka sath… humara sath hona mein he humari takat hai.. humari pehchan hai.. (
he smiles)
Abhi Daya ki pehchan…yaad hai ACP sir kye khata hain?(
he added wd smile)
mera do Bazo meri takat hain? hum sirf ACP sir ki he takat nahin hain..balka aik dosra ki bhi takat hain..

Daya (
teary tone):
Boss tum na muja mahf kar diya iss ka matlab?


Abhijeet hugs him with…


Abhijeet (
teary tone)
: tuja itni saza daa chukka hoon apna dil par pather rak kar..ab aur tuja apna sa juda nai kar sakta main… tuja mahf nai karon ga tu..kud ko kasa mahf karon ga main? Iss takleef main aur kud ko nai jala sakta main..

Daya: Abhi..i m very sorry..maine buht galat kiya..

Abhijeet (
still in hug):

Daya (
scared):

Abhijeet: warna yah ka (
separates him from that hug)
main ACP sir ko bata don ga ka tum na (
whispering)
sharab pee thi…aur sirf yahi nai ..yah bhi ka tum na sharb ka nasha mein larie bhi ki kssi sa (
pointing towards his facial wounds)



Daya shocked ..he looks himself in mirror and became more shocked…


Daya (
screams):
oh My God..kye sach main? (
he looks at back towards Abhijeet who was smiling at him)
par tuma kasa pata ka sharab ka nasha main hi larie hui? Pehla bhi tu ho sakti hai?

Abhijeet (
amazed tone):
haan ho tu sakti hai…wasa bhi jitna gusa chara tha tuma..kssi ki bhi shamat aya sakti thi..shukar hai main bech gaya..
Daya embarresed.. he looks at Abhijeet and found him smiling and happy… he feels great sooth in his heart which was full wd so much pain bcz of him only...


Daya (
naughty):
wasa tuma kasa pata ka larie hi hui kssi sa? (
Abhijeet looks at him questionly)
ho sakta hai tum na mara ho… gusa tu tuma bhi buht tha muj par..

Abhijeet (
looking shocked):
kye? tuma lagta hai ka main tuma asa mar sakta hoon..?

Daya (
starts rubbing his hand on his cheek):
mara tu tha…


Abhijeet smiles after seeing cute face of Daya….


Abhijeet: abhi tu aur marna chiya tha… (
Daya again moves his head downward)
Acha chalu abi utth jayo aur fresh ho jayo. Nashta ready hai..pher doctor ka pas bhi jana hai…

Daya: wo kyun?

Abhijeet: Pata nai ACP sir ka call aya tha abi thori dar pehla..wo kah raha tha ka Doctor na kaha hai ka reports aye gai hain..tuma kuch nai hua par medicines wo tuma check karna ka bad he dan ga..

Daya (
relieving):
Thanks God..muja tu laga kuch gar bar ho jaya gii zaroor…


He looks at Abhijeet..who was seeing him angrly from corner of his eyes..and changes in a bit as..


Daya: wo ..wo.. main change kar ka ata hoon.. ..bht bhook lagi hai..
He stood up and directly went into the washroom…Abhijeet nodded his head in No and then moves outside..



After taking shower and changing Daya moves towards dinning table..where Abhijeet served him break fast..Tears were coming in his eyes again n again.. but he was removing it before Abhijeet noticed it..he was looking really embarress bcz of all what he did…after seeing Abhijeet love towards him he was not be able to control his tears.. he was missing him badly and today he got him back unexpectedly..this was so so shocking and relieving as well for him at the same moment..what he can never say in his consciousness …he said all that to his big brother in sub consuousness.. but at least he said.. that's was so important.. today everything was clear again between them..when they did not says so manythings to each other..bcz sometime words doesn't make such importance .. how much Feel stays there.. Today they are on such level when they can easily understand each other unspoken words..the silence between them.. they can understand that NEED of any person is more n more important then blood relations.. they can FEEL that they are NEED of each other..anyone can neglect anything..but not such realtiy of their lives…



Abhijeet places his hand on Daya's shoulder..Daya with jerk looks at him and realized..he instantly removes his tears from his eyes…


Abhijeet: Dayaaa? Tum teak ho?

Daya: haan haan boss.. I m fine..wo..wo (
looking here n there)
newspaper kahan hai boss?


Abhijeet really knows what Daya is trying to do..he also don't want to discuss all that stuff again n again.. it's enough for him that his Daya is with him..and he knows well that this is all abt Daya as well…he replies him as..


Abhijeet: wo ajj sa nai aya ga… maine newspaper wala ko mana kar diya hai..

Daya (
looks at him shockingly):
wo kyun?

Abhijeet (
looks at him):
kyun ka newspaper par ka (
stress)
logon ko taran taran ka ulta seeda khyal ata hain…


Daya embarresed..while Abhijeet smiles scertly… Daya instantly starts taking breakfast..Abhijeet controls but he burst into laughter..he patted on his back with..


Abhijeet: Daya tu bhi naa….

Daya (
smiles n looks him back):
Daya tu bhi kye? (
naughtly)
kye boss…


Abhijeet comes towards him and speak after cupping his face into his hands…


Abhijeet (
serious):
Meri jaan hai…


Tears came in Daya's eyes…he stood up and after hugging Abhijeet..whoes eyes filled with tears too says as..


Daya: Aur boss tum na..tum na meri zindagii ho…main tumara bina jee nai sakta…

Abhijeet (
hugging him):
Main janta hoon Daya..aur tum nahin..hum..hum nai jee sakta aik dosra bina abb..aur yah baat kabhi mat boolna..chaya koi kuch bhi kaha..

Daya: I promise boss…main kabhi ksi ki baton par dehan nai doon ga..humara rishta pavitar hai.. ager dosron ki nazren gandi hain tu hum kye Karen?

Abhijeet: exactly… chalu abi nashta kar ka niklen…


Bothe sepreated from that hug and after removing tears from their eyes again sarted their breakfast..After few moments Daya again asked naughtly…


Daya : wasa boss…(
Abhijeet looks at him)
tum na bola..Daya Tu bhi… yah bhi ka kye matlab hua…main bhi jaan hoon..(
winks)
Aur kon jaan hai… Ta..tarika jee..

Abhijeet (
shy look):
Daya…nashta kar chup chap…
And Daya starts laughing… After few seconds Abhijeet looks at him and says…


Abhijeet: Daya wo.. wo..maine ..maine Tarika ko purpose kar diya…

Daya: kye? (
Shockingly)
yah kab hua? (
excited)
Aur uss na kye kaha pher?

Abhijeet (
casually):
kye khana tha.. haan bol di…


Daya stood up and hugs him tightly with…


Daya: boss I m so so happy..so happy… Dil kush kar diya tum na tu….


Abhijeet who was still sitting on dinning chair, tries to hug him ..but starts coughing bcz bite struck in his throat….Daya instantly left him and gave him water with…


Daya (
tense):
sorry sorry boss..lo pani peeyo…(
Abhijeet drinks two sips) Daya starts rubbing his back…


Abhijeet: Aby marwaya ga kye…


After seeing Abhijeet fine..Daya sat down on his chair and replies him naughtly….


Daya: Kye baat karta ho boss…abi tu tuma (
winks)
gorhi charna hai.. Tarika ko lana jana hai…asa kasa …haan…


Abhijeet stood up with shy look ..but before he can hit Daya…Daya starts running and laughing..Abhijeet running behind him too and laughing as well with..


Abhijeet (
laughing):
Daya ka becha….

Daya (
trying to save himself):
Boss..kye kar raha ho…


Abhijeet grabs Sofa cushon in his hand and starts beating Daya… Daya was happily enjoying this..soon Daya too grabs another cushon and starts fighting with Abhijeet and laughing madly… Duo house were filled with voice of magical laugh once again…





AUTHOR's NOTE:





Kye Guys Fata Fat Review he nai kiya sab na..tu main kasa fata fat update karti...but still jaldi update kar rai hoon... Kye guys iss bar reviews ka mamla mein bht sad kiya ...Story likhna ka maza he nai aya..:(



Anyways, one of the Guest asked me that DS and this is same kinda stuff..Then I want to explain that in DS Abhijeet by luck reached at the moment and he saved Daya..otherwise he was coming back to home to settle everything. And DS was mixture of so many incidents.. sometimes by luck and sometimes due to their own mistakes.. it was special story.. I can write so many stories on all those incidents but I make the one master piece.. And abt this story then I already revealed that Abhijeet was intentionally doing it... he want to punish want to make him realize the effects or true meanings of all those what he did.. And Abt Daya's health issue..i did not rise it at big level that Abhijeet forget everything and be back at Daya..but yah he can't continue his punishment. Which was intentional act only...he is not such type of person..so I kept in my mind his personality while writing this...I really tries to Clear that Daya n Abhijeet aik dosra ki NEED ko smjen..FEEL karen..aur uss base par he wapis payen aik dosra ko..That was concept of this story..and i ended it on that point only... I explained Daya's health issue bcz if I neglect it...it can be a loophole..Asi medicines lana ka bad Side effects na 's not possible.. otherwise Abhijeet ko Daya ko mahf tu karna he tha..after giving him sufficient punishment.. wink.. bcz he was doing everything intentionally to make him realize only what he was feeling.. I did not mind dear..I got ur point but Frankly speaking I always tries to write on something different.. but readers like SUSPENSEFUL n EMOTIONAL Stuff by my side so I m helpless...And Thank you so much for ur review.. Hugs..
