Well, anyways (I'm sharing this because it doesn't feel right to talk to you guys without sharing a bit of my life with you) so there's this girl in my class and we used to be best friends, but this year she has become a total jerk! And you know how when you don't like someone everything they do is just an awful thing to do? Yeah, well, yesterday in gym we were playing dodgeball and she kept cheating! And it was soooo annoying because she was hit in the middle of her chest and we (everyone on my team) would yell "You're out!" Abut she would completely ignore it! So we all hit her at, like, the exact same time and she pretends that she's still in, so everyone on my team starts yelling at her. The gym teacher comes over and tells her she's out and so what does this girl do? She cries! SHE FLIPPING CRIES!



Sorry, I needed to get that out of my system. Goodbye now. :)
