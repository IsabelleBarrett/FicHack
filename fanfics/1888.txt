This was my first story on here also, and I just have one thing to say to you guys: I can't finish this story. No matter what I think about and how many times I sit down to continue...I've been away too long, and it kills me, it really does, because I had such great dreams for this story.

I don't want to continue writing for this wonderful story only to have it not feel the same. It wouldn't be right to Hayley. It wouldn't be right to you guys, the dearest people who have reviewed and were the ones that had me keep trying and trying to continue...but I just can't.

So many things in my life have changed since I've last written a chapter, I'm not in the same mindset, even my writing style has changed. It might sound dumb, but I just can't bring myself to write a kick ass chapter.

You guys deserve nothing less.

I want to offer this story up for adoption. I've seen other writes do it, and I hope that this little jewel right here speaks enough to someone that they want to take it under their wing and spruce it up, take care of it.

Raise it up to be the story I know ti could be with some TLC.

Once again, I'm sorry! You guys have been the best followers, and I hope that when/if I come out with more Damon/OC stories you might read them, even if I couldn't even finish this one.

I love you guys so much,
