"Sorry to ruin your weekend plans," JJ said as her team made their way into the conference room at eight fifteen Saturday morning.

She handed files to her colleagues and pulled up images on the monitor.

"It's not like we had anything better to do," said Prentiss.

"Speak for yourself," said Reid "I was in the process of translating the black and white film Earth versus the Flying Saucers from English to Latin. It was a film done in 1956 directed by Fred Sears. It's kind of cheesy in terms of plot but the storyline is your typical aliens want to dominate the earth which makes it pretty cool."

Prentiss smiled, "My mistake."

"So what have we got," Hotchner asked JJ, getting focused.

JJ began giving the report. "Five kids all under the age of ten Manhattan area of New York. Three boys, two girls. The only pattern that the 12th precinct has been able to uncover is that our unsub alternates genders. Kills a boy on Monday, a girl on Tuesday, a boy on Wednesday and so forth. The media has all ready named him the Weekday Killer."

"Great just what we need," said Hotchner.

"Do we have a time table on when these murders occurred?" Morgan asked.

"Unfortunately there's no consistency," JJ answered. "Some of them have either been taken before or after school."

The room turned slightly grim.

"So if we don't catch this guy," said Prentiss, "He could have two more victims on his hands by the time the weekend's over."

"Let's try and get there before that happens," said Hotch. "Wheel's up in fifteen."
