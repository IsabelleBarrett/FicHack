

I'm not scared

As the night covers me up

Smiling as I skip

It should be fine if I complain now

Hey, can I talk for a bit?

It's about some shameful habits

But I can't keep quiet now

I'll be super quick

So, will you listen?

Well,

I'll tell you all

There's something strange

About me

I've covered it up

But it always troubles me

One day-

That was about

Ten years ago-

My grandmother

Died in front of me

Not seeing that I had no heart

She said "You're a kind girl."

Since then, I've been a 'sweet girl'

The only one I couldn't fool died

I've always been just a monster

Oh, sorry!

Please don't cry!

I'm just telling a story!

Oh, how shameful!

So disgraceful!

I lie about it all

It's the truth-yet you can't see through my smile

I'm deceiving

Turn the other way

As the lies pile up

Once again,

I feel no mirth

Reading-could vanish very soon,

A girl who nibbles on stories

Writing-could cry in a second,

A boy who hates lies

Yes, I used them

As they thought I was a 'sweet girl'

And their hearts were hurt

As they noticed the truth

Shuji is no longer alive

So there's no way I can go on living

Is that a lie?

No, not this time!

My black soul says that I have to go

Oh, how shameful!

Listen closely!

I feel nothing

Doesn't matter if it's my ego, my lies, or the truth

Tell me I'm not human, then I can die

I'm just a monster making jaws drop

Oh, how shameful!

How I hate it!

Come on, listen to me!

You look distressed, but

I can't be saved!

You say "I'll help you live!"?

Oh, you two are strange

"Whoops, I messed up!"

As always, I'll be living in a shameful life
