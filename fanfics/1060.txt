The reason is because this story was started before naruto ended and I want my story to line up with all the universes my crossover includes. I am currently working hard in a way to please everyone and it won't include that much bashing because I'm not too big a fan on that unless that character has it coming. i'm gonna try to keep this story as cannon as possible but it is a crossover so it may be a little different.
