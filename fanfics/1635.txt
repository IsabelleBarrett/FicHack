


ATTENTION, REVIEWERS, GUESTS, READERS, FAVORITERS, AND FOLLOWERS! THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!



Well, not really, but I needed to get your attention somehow, right? Anyway, I have a challenge for all of you! A while back, I found a picture on DeviantArt by 1sthi1357 made of Dino TK, from my story,
Of Dinos and Digimon
. Last night, when I was looking at it again, it gave me an idea!



I am not a drawing person. I trace, but don't draw. Which is why I want to ask you guys if you could draw for me! Well, not for me, but from my stories.



This is what I mean: you draw things from my stories and post them on DeviantArt, I'll mention them in the story they're from. There is no cost or prize, except maybe a Llama and my eternal happiness!



Here are the rules:



1. You
MUST
include my name in the description so I can find it and the name of the story it's from.



2. It doesn't have to be a good picture, it can be whatever. I want to see what you all can come up with!



3. You can make multiple works of art, not just one piece.



4. They can either be character designs, scenes (or comics) from the story, or title pictures.



Now that that's done with, I hope you guys take on the challenge! See you!
