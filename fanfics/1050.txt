Hello, Hello everyone! I see you've seen I've come off my...hiatus. (What a gross word). I do apologize. However I do have an important question for the masses that do partake in the enjoyment of reading Changing Fate. I've gone back and re-read and obviously as my own worst critique feel as though...things progressed too quickly and my writing is quite juvenile. I have someone reading it and giving me feedback, and she is wonderful, and a phenomenal friend to be doing this for me but alas, has not seen the anime or read the manga of xxxHolic. So I am looking for a second opinion.

How are you finding it so far?

Are Natsuki and Doumeki progressing too fast?

Is the humor not there?

Are my characters OOC?

Is there anything I can improve upon?

Do any parts not make sense?

If I were to rewrite, I think I'd try to follow the anime closer. In a way of rewriting the episode with Natsuki in there, as I have seen others do.

This story is for my enjoyment, yes but it would be nothing without the support from you all. So any feedback I will gladly take.

And now I am back into it, I have started working on Chapter 12
++PLUS++
a little side story about the four of them got the cafe up and running.

Thank you in advance for your feedback, and do look forward to Chapter 12 of Changing Fate!
