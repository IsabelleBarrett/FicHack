Hello all!

This is my first fanfic for YGO Zexal so please be nice to me :) I love the series SO MUCH (and Astral's observations crack me up) so I thought I would write this for the heck of it.

In this fanfiction, Astral interacts (and observes the actions, also adding some of his amazing observations) with the many people from the Yugioh Zexal Cast (From the goodies to the badies) and soon, it will be YOUR decision as to who he will interact with next and the place of interaction.



Example:


Yuma and Astral - In his bedroom - subject of conversation: Yuma's bad habits


This is going to be guaranteed fun (and possibly torture) and hopefully, I can even do a truth or dare round! So get reviewing!


Disclaimer:
I do not own Yugioh Zexal :(



~ Astral Interaction 1 ~



Astral and his (sometimes completely hopeless) friend, Yuma Tsukamo



~ Yuma Tsukamo's Bad habits (and something about Tori)~



Yuma is sitting on his hammok while Astral is floating above him with his arms crossed.



*Moment of silence*



Yuma -
So...


Astral -
Hm?


Yuma -
Why are we here again?

*astral sighs*


Astral -
I have confronted you to discuss some notable actions that I have been observing from you these past months. I have told you this 5 minutes ago.


Yuma -
OH! so that was what you were talking about!

*astral sighs exasperated*


Yuma -
But it sounds BO~ORING! why now? We could do this tommorow or later ya know! We have people to duel!


Astral - *ignoring him*
I have grown tired of your recent actions and I would like them to be stopped. So i am here to put my irritations to rest.


Yuma -
*sigh* WHATEVER! So what d'ya wanna tell me?


Astral -
Firstly, your way of eating.


Yuma -
HUH?! What about me eating? It's just what we ALL have to do!...well...apart from you.


Astral -
*getting slightly irritated* I have noticed that you ALWAYS speak with your mouth full of food and some fly out of your mouth. For some reason, everytime I see that, I feel DISGUSTED.


Yuma -
Well, that's just how I eat! No biggie!


Astral -
Yuma, I am serious. I feel horrid when you spit out your sources of replinishment.


Yuma -
Well...uh...that's just how I eat! *
it's not like the way I eat is hurting anyone you jerk!*



Astral -

*I can hear you through our thoughts remember?*



Yuma -
Uwaa! Astral!


Astral -
*rubs his temple*
Observation number 14: My partner Yuma, eats like what they call, 'a pig'
. Let us get back on topic.


Yuma -
Ugh! Astral you are NOT my mum! I'm not a baby anymore! I'm old enough now-


Astral -

that is debatable.



Yuma -
*irritated* -to do what I want!


Astral -
Then why do your family members, who are clearly older than you, eat perfectly normal?


Yuma -
Because THAT'S THEM! IT'S NOT ME! HMMPH!


Astral -
So they are more mature than you.


Yuma -
Don't make me punch you, you blue flashlight!


Astral -
I cannot be touched physically in case you noticed.


Yuma -
...One day.


Astral - *fed up*
All I am asking of you, is to eat normally.


Yuma -
hmmph...what's in it for me?


Astral -
I will not tell your friend Tori of what you say during the night as you sleep.


Yuma -
*FREEZE*...What do I...?


Astral -
I wonder what she will be like when I tell her, "Tori, make me a sandwich" from Yuma, hmm?


Yuma -
ughhhhaaaAAAA! F-FINE! I-I'll eat properly...

*Astral smiles satisfied*


Astral -
Well that settles one thing. Now another thing.


Yuma -
WHAT NOW~!


Astral -
Your sleeping habits.


Yuma -
What?! I sleep! you don't! you don't get anything about our kind!


Astral -
I would rather sleep than listen to the noises that come out of your mouth while you sleep.


Yuma -
Snoring?


Astral -
I do not get this, 'snoring'.


Yuma -
Well smarty pants, we usually make noises in our sleep.


Astral -
But why?


Yuma -
Uh I dunno! ask my grandma or something!


Astral -

I think even the numbers in his key can also hear their hopeless master snore.



Astral -
And what about when you talk in your sleep? that is a more dire problem.


Yuma -
...Astral.


Astral -
Yes?


Yuma -
What do I say in my sleep?


Astral -
most are about your hunger
(I should ask him what a 'riceball' is later on),
your schooling
(no wonder he has achieved nothing in terms of his education),
your usual saying is "I'm feeling the flow!" but your other ones had something to do with Tori since you seemed to mention her numerous times-


Yuma -
Wait what?!


~10 MINUTES LATER



Astral -
I have to say, if you really have affectionate feelings for Tori, swallow your pride and go tell her yourself to "make me a sandwich" and those other things...Yuma?


*Yuma's body is sprawled onto the floor in shock and embaressment*



*Astral does another sight and closes his eyes in thought*



Astral -
Now recall:
Observation number 14:
My partner Yuma eats like "a pig",
Observation number 14 (a):
Some humans like Yuma, like to make strange noises during the night because "They can",
Observation number 14 (b):
Humans like Yuma, also speak of unrelated things as they sleep, even about their friends cooking abillities and ************,
Observation 14 (c):
After talking of crucial things (embarrasing things), humans tend to fall on their heads and start moaning "why, why me" while hurting themselves numerous times.


*Astral sits atop the hammok while Yuma bangs his head on the ground repeatedly*



Astral -
*sigh* why has fate chosen me to be paired with this hopeless child?


Yuma
- I AM NOT HOPELESS AND I'M SO NOT A CHI~LD!


Astral -
Again, my partner says things that are quite debatable.


Yuma -
SHUUUUUT UUPPPP!


Okay, that's first chappie!

Now, that we've finished torturing Yuma, who should Astral interact with NEXT?


Remember:


Astral and ? - location *in heartland city but not anywhere else - subject of conversation

Ok chao!


Yuma -
I can't believe you made me do this...


Astral -
I find this what you call a 'fanfiction' quite interesting indeed. I wonder who I shall talk with next.


ME -
Remember Astral. It can be ANYONE from the cast. Your time with Yuma is JUST THE BEGINING.
