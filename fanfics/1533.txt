'Can this night get any worse' she thought while leaning against a tree. The branches were just enough to shelter her from the storm for a bit.

Her head snapped up when she heard a crashing sound. She stumbled as the earth shook with another crashing sound. It was much closer this time. She braced herself as she turned toward the presence she could now feel strongly.

She drew her bow just as the tree to her left was brought down. "Well, it just got worse" she said aloud.
