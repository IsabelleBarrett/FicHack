

Ladies and Gentlemen!

This is a very brief message to inform you all of the impending arrival of a renewed Black Knight tale, bringing us all back to the world of Remnant however there are some major differences to expect!

1. Noir Chevalier is -not- attending Beacon academy at the time of the new story.

2. Update times will not be frequent. Instead, I will be posting larger chapters (or two chapters at the same time) to satisfy you all before taking hiatus' that could last as long as two months. This is due to Uni work.

3. My muse has changed and, with that, the tone of the story. Responding to a reader of Black Leaves I've decided to announce that the new tale will hopefully explore more mature themes such as human (and faunus) morality in a world that simply wants to kill them.

These are the major points I wanted to bring to your attention and after all this time if you're still a fan of the Black Knight I look forward to entertaining you once more. If you have a question regarding the new tale, feel free to send me a PM here.


Next on the Black Knight of Thread: Chapter 1 - White Noise



Noblesse oblige
