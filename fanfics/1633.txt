CHAPTER ONE: Megan

Megan was a normal mortal. She was doing her homework when something banged on her bedroom window. Megan got up and opened the window. A gust of wind blew in, and a voice said:


Megan the mortal,



you shall come forth.



To Mount Olympus,



away you go.



Pack your bags,



and get set for the road.


Megan gasped. Only special mortals got to visit Mount Olympus!

Immediately, Megan started to pack her bags.
Hmm, what should I bring to Mount Olympus? I have to impress the goddesses and gods there.
Megan packed all of her fancy togas and dresses. She also shoved in all different colored sandals. In her other bag, she packed her hair supplies, makeup, and textscrolls.

Since she was wearing ripped jeans and a jersey, she decided to change into a toga. The toga was light blue, like the sky, with white around the rims.

Megan left a note for her parents, and stood outside of her house, letting the wind blow her toga. She smiled.


WOOSH!


Wind came at her so hard, she had to hold onto her toga. Once the clouds moved away, a white chariot stood in front of her. The chariot had elegant wings on each side, and in gold painting, it said
Hermes Delivery Service.


"Megan the mortal?" came a man's voice. "That's me." Megan said loudly, over the sound of the flapping wings. "Come on in, already! I have other deliveries." Megan grabbed her bags and climbed into the chariot.


I can't believe I'm going to Mount Olympus!
she thought as the chariot took off.
