It is written by PrincessAmerica, or rather, Sara, who has rather...strong beliefs, and a mindset that if you don't share her beliefs you are a devil worshiping ass. Joy, right? Nope. There are thirty five chapters in this story plus one chapter of the sequel, we did not review the sequel and have no interest in reviewing the sequel.

Because this story kind of rips into a rather touchy subject, you might be offended when you read it. So, if you are easily offended or quick to anger by the following subjects; Extreme homophobia, terrible, and I mean
terrible
spelling, grammar, story telling, major character derailment, plot derailment, inability to keep two worlds separate, extreme narcissism from author, racism, main character slash author being a complete bitch but everyone loves her, altering history on infamous and serious points in time and thinking she's right, than you might not want to read this.

I want to point out now that Spades and I become rather harsh further in the story as our patience for this author begins to disappear. To put it simply; we say rather mean things and have the utmost hatred for this story.

But whatever we say, no matter how cruel, no matter how angry, are just words. We don't actually want to hurt the author, we could care less about Sara to be honest. She's just an obnoxious, racist thirteen year old with serious homophobia problems. We say we want her to die a lot later in the story but we do not. We do not actually want her to die or anything. We just want her to stop writing these awful stories.

That being said; read at your own risk.
