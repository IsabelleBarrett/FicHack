A/N: Written for The Indigo League Challenge by reminiscent-afterthought and for my starter Pokémon I chose is Charmander. Hope I do this right, I've not really done much writing for fandoms outside of Harry Potter. In this drabble I wrote of it I followed the rules of writing with a max word limit of 100, did not mention the names of the character I used, used 15 words that are 8 letters long or are longer than 8 letters long, I did not use 'say/said' and out of the letters I did used I did not use the letters Q and Z.




Relaxing Afternoon's



As the afternoon disappeared giving way to evening a delicate smile appeared on her glowing face, illuminated by the descending sun. Her eyes sparkled with contentment as she took a delicious sip of her Jasmine tea while taking in the extremely beautiful scenery of her garden. Thanks to her hard work, tender loving care and a helping hand provided by Mother Nature her garden shone with unexpected beauty as the mixture of amazing scents that helped to provide an extremely calming atmosphere for the grass type Pokémon.

Drinking tea in her garden with her grass type Pokémon was pure heaven.


The End.



The character I used in this little drabble was the Grass type Gym Leader Erika.
