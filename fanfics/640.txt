


GodofGreed: Welcome to demi-virus. This is my first crossover, so I hope you enjoy it.



Percy: Should we tell them what the story is about?



GodofGreed: Of course! In this story; Percy was forgotten at camp for his half-brother, Annabeth cheated on him, his mom and Paul are in a coma, and Percy can't afford to get them better treatment. So he decides to leave America, and travel to France.



Percy: I'm almost surprised Poseidon didn't notice me.


Almost.




GodofGreed: XANA saw Percy use his powers, and decided to possess him. XANA brought Percy to Lyoko, and then sent monsters disguised as the Lyoko warriors. So when Percy met the


real


Lyoko warriors, he attacked them.



Percy: I thought they were my enemies!



GodofGreed: After XANA gets the keys to Lyoko, he sends the Scyphozoa to possess Percy, and Percy destroys the core of Lyoko. Percy ended up like William in the actual show.



Percy: *grumbles sarcastically* Becoming a puppet and being blown to bits was

so much fun

. Thanks GodofGreed.



GodofGreed: Your welcome. So XANA was destroyed when he created his own virtual avatar, and the group freed Percy from XANA's control.



Percy: I absorbed XANA and took all his power and memories. In other words, I'm the new XANA, just without the desire to destroy everyone.



GodofGreed: So know Percy is friends with the group and even materializes himself to spend time with them in the real world.



Percy: During one of these trips, we passed a reporter, and we were all caught on live footage. Athena apparently watches every news network in the world, and she saw me.



GodofGreed: I don't own Code Lyoko or Percy Jackson. Enjoy, comment, follow, or favorite this story please.

The bell that signaled the end of the school day rang…about 10 minutes before it was supposed to. The students cheered and the teachers went to check if something was wrong with the bells. "What a nice surprise. I love it when we get out early!" Odd exclaimed. Ulrich replied, "Yeah, but this was no surprise." Odd just grinned sheepishly in response. Aelita told the rest of the group, "I wonder what Percy wants." Jeremy replied, "He did seem a bit anxious when he called last night." The group continued to chat about their mysterious friend.

"Boo!" The group jumped at the sudden shout. The person who yelled was looked about 17 years old, wore black pants (with a red trident facing down on the side), a black shirt (with a red eye of XANA on it), an unzipped jacket (with the eye of XANA unzipped), black fingerless gloves (with a red eye of XANA on both), black shoes, black hair, and sea-green eyes. Odd put a hand to his chest and exclaimed (overdramatically), "Oh my god. You scared us half to death. How could you scare your best friends half to death? This is just like…" Odd proceeded to make a joke nobody could understand, when he finished Percy told him, "I think that was the strangest joke I've ever heard. I've heard jokes about men and guinea pigs, but this makes less sense than
that
! (
AN: Sea of Monsters)
" The group, plus Odd, looked at him strangely.

Jeremy cleared his throat and said, "So, you wanted to tell us something?" Percy replied, "Yes I did. You guys want to go for a walk?" A few minutes later, they were at an ice cream store. The group saw a man being arrested. The group saw a reporter nearby, they moved closer trying to overhear what was being said, and the reporter asked a cop, "How did you know the drug dealer, dubbed 'addiction', would be here today?" The cop replied, "It was weird. Last night at the station all of the machines stopped working, then a weird symbol that looked like a mix of a target and an eye showed up on all the screens, and then all the machines came back online. The strangest thing was that the machines now work faster, and they have information we did not have before."

The Lyoko warriors all turned to Percy who rubbed the back of his head and chuckled sheepishly. After a moment, they all burst out laughing. Odd told everyone, "Hmm…a symbol that's a mix between an eye and a target. Why does that sound familiar?" The group chuckled at Odd's antics and went to get some ice cream.

When they all got ice cream, Ulrich asked Percy, "So what did you want to tell us?" Percy answered, "I decided I'm going to visit my mom and step-dad back home in New York City." The group was silent for a moment, digesting the thought that they don't know their friend so well. Jeremy replied, "I'm so sorry. When you were under XANA's control, we didn't think about possible family."

Percy waved it off and told him, "It's not a problem, because…they're both in a coma." The table went silent with shock, so Percy continued, "I came to France because I wanted to escape it all. Now that I have XANA's abilities, I can go home and give them the treatment they need."

Yumi asked, "Why didn't you stay in New York City? I mean, you couldn't possibly have known about XANA or any possible benefits like that." Percy answered, "You're right. But that wasn't the
only
thing I wanted to escape from."

Before anyone could ask, Percy continued, "My girlfriend cheated on me with my half-brother, people forgot I existed, and my dad favored my half-brother who's the same age as me. He completely forgot I exist."

No one said anything for a moment. Ulrich broke the silence, "No wonder you left. Anyone would. I may have problems with my dad, but at least he knows I exist." They continued to talk, unaware of the consequences of passing in front of a filming camera…

Athena was watching the news, as the goddess of wisdom; she has to be aware of important events going on in the world now. She was not watching one screen, but one per country. Each screen showed the most viewed news network, and if that was unavailable, it showed what was going on in that countries government. Athena watched as the police caught the drug dealer known as addiction.

Athena thought, '
What a foolish nickname.
' Athena was shocked at what she saw next: Percy Jackson (wearing black and red) and a group of teenagers walked past the camera chuckling. Athena's gray eyes grew even wider at what the police officer said, "
It was weird. Last night at the station all of the machines stopped working, then a weird symbol that looked like a mix of a target and an eye showed up on all the screens…
" Athena stopped paying attention after that. Athena thought, "
It sounds like that weird symbol that showed up during the World War two. Even stranger is what Percy Jackson was wearing.
" Athena then left to ask Zeus to call a meeting…and get Annabeth and Mark (Percy's half-brother) there as well.

It was after dinner at camp half-blood, and the hunters have just won yet another game of capture the flag. Annabeth and Thalia were siting on a log, drinking from camp glasses (
AN: Remember, they fill themselves up with whatever drink you want
), and talking about what's been going on. Suddenly, Mark appeared holding a glass. When Mark got closer he said, "Hey Anna, just got you a drink." Annabeth replied, "Thanks Mark, but we already have glasses. See?" Mark looked a bit panicked when he saw that. He tried again, "Well, I made this just for you. Go on, give it a try."

The answer he got made him angrier, "No thanks, I'm fine." Mark scowled, "Just take it gods damn it!" Then he threw the contents of the glass at her. Thalia, thanks to her hunter instincts, reacted fast enough to pull Annabeth and herself away from whatever the drink was.

Thalia screamed at him, "What the Hades is wrong with you?" The scream caught the attention of nearby campers, Chiron, and Dionysus. When Chiron arrived he asked, "What is going on here?" Thalia replied, "Mark offered Annabeth a drink, but when she said no, he threw it at her!"

A boy, no older than 12 stepped forward and asked, "Can I see the cup?" Marks sneered, "Why does it matter to you?" He replied, "That cup looks just like the one my little sister gave me just before I came to camp. Earlier today, I was making a love potion and I used that cup. My little sister wrote something on the bottom of the cup; if that is my cup, then odds are you've just been sneaking love potions to Annabeth since you started dating."

Thalia handed him the cup, and ignoring Mark's sputtering; he read, "`To my big brodda Lenny. Have fun at camp.' Yep, this is definitely my cup." Everybody glared at Mark, especially Annabeth. Before Mark could defend himself, Hermes appeared and told everyone, "Athena has just called a meeting and all of the gods, goddesses, hunters, camp leaders, and cabin leaders need to attend. Apollo will pick you up in ten minutes."

When all the gods, goddesses, cabin leaders, camp leaders (campers that are not cabin leaders, but have a lot of authority), Chiron, and the hunters were assembled, Zeus turned to his daughter and asked, "Athena, why have you called for a meeting? (
AN: If you thought I was going to write 'Daughter, why have thou summoned us?' Then you have either never read PJO books, do not pay attention when the gods are mentioned in the book, been taking with my friend who told me to write that, or all of the above
) Is there something we should know?" Athena replied, "I believe there is."

Turning to her uncle, Poseidon, she continued, "Have you spoken to your son recently?" Poseidon looked confused but answered, "Of course I have. Mark is in this meeting right now." Athena responded, "No, I meant your other son, Percy Jackson." Poseidon put a hand to his chin and said, "Percy…I haven't seen the boy in about a year! I wonder how he's doing."

Annabeth was thinking, `
I can't believe I dumped Percy just because of a stupid love potion! I don't deserve to be a daughter of Athena.
' Athena informed the whole room, "I was watching the news (Ares and Aphrodite groaned, Hermes and Apollo were playing games on their phone, Hades, Hephaestus, &amp; Dionysus looked bored and annoyed, Zeus and Hera were paying a bit of attention to Athena, and Poseidon and a few others looked confused) when I saw a drug dealer being arrested in France. What made me call this meeting is what I saw in the background. Percy Jackson was there with a group of mortal teenagers."

The silence (sans Apollo and Hermes dropping their phones) was deafening. Poseidon broke the silence, "This can't be…Percy is still at camp." Chiron told him, "Actually, Percy has not been seen at camp in quite some time, lord Poseidon." Then all Hades broke loose.

Percy sneezed. The Tarantula that was walking next to him and made some noises, which translated as, `
Are you well master?
' Percy answered, "I'm fine, I just didn't know you could sneeze when you're digital. Tomorrow, I'll ask the Lyoko warriors to help me out on a project, then it's off to the Big Apple!"
