A Highwayman whom was hired to kill Jessica.

I thought this time Ginjer would be a bigger help now. Not liking the idea of a 12 year old going off alone with a wolf as his only companion Ginjer follows Travis and aids him and annoys in the best way she can.


A.N. I will get to work of this story soon, maybe after I make the Fable (1) story but I made the cover and I figured I would give a sneak peek at what I had planned. For those who don't know Skorm and Avo are the Gods of the Albion world Avo the God of Light and Good and Skrom the God of Evil and Darkness. Who better to be the father of the Crawler, Corrupter and Nightmare then the power house of all evil. I really hope you will enjoy what I got in store and hope you can be a little patient.
