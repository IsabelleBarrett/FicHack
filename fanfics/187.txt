Serena POV

"Good work Absol!" I praised. Calem sighed as he returned own Absol.

"How do you always beat me?" Calem asked.

"Whoa! Go Serena!" Shauna cheered.

I laughed and shrugged. "I don't know but I managed to beat your Mega Evolved Absol without even needing to use my Mega Ring."

Trevor laughed. "Better luck next time Calem." Calem nodded.

"Serena! You have a phone call!" My mom yelled.

"Really? If anyone needs me they call my Holo Castor. Who's calling?" I asked returning my Absol.

"She didn't say." My mom explained.

"I'll be back you guys." I said.

Tierno nodded. "Sure thing Serena!" I walked pass my mom and went to the phone.

"I need to go to the basement. I'll be up in a minute." My mom said and she went downstairs. I picked up the phone.

"Hello? Serena Yvette speaking." I said. I didn't know if this was a business offer or what. As the champion I get a lot for request for commercials and crap like that.

"Serena?! Is that you?" A panicked voice asked.

"Emma? What's wrong?" I asked.

"I need help and lots of it! You are like a big sister to me and I don't know who else to ask!" Emma complained.

"Talk then. You can tell me anything." I said.

"Well I don't know where to begin. Well Eris, Sedna, and Nix left the Bureau to be pick their own path. Oh have you heard! Eris and Nix are together!" Emma exclaimed.

"Really? Wow. Some best friend she is. I got no text or nothing. Not even a quick call saying 'Hey! Nix is my boyfriend bye!'" I laughed.

"Oh yeah back to business! So a lot and I mean a lot of chaos is happening Lumiose City! There is so much trouble in those dumb alley ways and worst of all Mimi is sick! She refuses to go to a Pokémon Center and I been wasting my time trying to get her feel better while more trouble is going on! I'm failing Looker!" Emma cried.

"That's terrible Emma. But what about the Expansion Suit?" I asked.

"It's not working! A wild Pokémon used Water Gun on it and it been malfunction ever since! If I even touch it, I will get shocked! By the time I get to the crime sense, everyone and thing is gone!" Emma sniffled.

I sighed and leaned against the wall. "Don't worry Emma. I'm coming over. Just give me about twenty minutes. I need to pack."

"WHAT?!" Emma yelled.

"Ouch!" I yelled pulling the phone away from my ear. I placed the phone back to my ear.

"Why are you yelling?" I asked.

"I mean you're putting your life on hold for me. I mean you are the champion and all. Aren't you busy?" Emma asked. "No I'm not. I'm taking time off from being the champion. It's annoying. I show up there because a trainer and they can't even make it any off The Elite Four. I end up just going home. That happened like five times a week so I toke time off. The only thing in my life right now is training." I explained.

"A-are you sure?" She sniffled.

"Of course little sister. Why not?" I laughed.

I heard Emma laugh too. "Okay then! Miss Looker your mission, if you chose to accept it, is to stop the chaos in Lumiose City."

"I accept the mission. I'll be over in about twenty minutes." I said.

"Okay! Bye!" Emma cheered. I hung up the phone. You see my code name is Miss Looker given to me by my partner Looker. It was kind of cheesy but it was from the heart and I was fine with it. His first choice was to give me his code name, Looker. But the dumb International Police Force wouldn't allow it so the next best thing was Miss Looker.

"Mom! I'm heading to Lumiose City for a while!" I yelled.

"Okay deer!" She yelled. I ran up the stairs to see my room. It's a good thing I always keep a bag packed. I grabbed my backpack and suit case and headed down the stairs. This was going to be fun. I opened the door to my house to go into the yard. My friends were talking.

"Hey Serena! What's with the bags?" Shauna asked. The boys noticed me and had the same look Shauna did. A look of confusing.

"It was The Elite Four. Apparently we're all traveling to Hoenn for some kind of trip. I didn't get that much detail. They said I will be told more on the plane." I lied. They cannot know about how I was connected to The International Police Force. It would put them in grave danger. Most low life criminals use that as an advantage for themselves.

"That's stinks. We'll see you soon." Tierno said. I nodded and headed out of the town. Lumiose City here I come.

Calem POV

"That's weird." Trevor thought aloud.

"What is?" I asked.

Trevor jumped. "What?"

"What's so weird Trevs?" Tierno asked.

Trevor sighed. "Well I have been doing my research and The Kalos League travels once a year for something to do with great Pokémon Professors and the other Champion League members. Serena just traveled to Johto last month. She already traveled with the Elite Four." Trevor explained.

"That is weird. Do you think she is hiding something from us?" Shauna asked.

"Only one way to find out. Talonflame follow Serena!" I yelled sending out my Pokémon. Talonflame nodded and flying towards Serena's path.

"I wonder why she lied to us." Tierno asked. Everyone shrugged. What was Serena up to?
