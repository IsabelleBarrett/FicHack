Sherlock," John greeted the addict cooly. "I'm glad we've found you again."



Sherlock's eyes were squinted at the outside light. Even so, he could just make out Mary's irritated expression. He had meant to disappear after it all, hadn't meant to be discovered.



"

Are you?"



"

No, because I have to deal with the fact you're doing this." John yanked him forward towards the car. "Mycroft was lucky to stumble upon you."



Luck. Yes.



Sherlock was a wreck, practically pulling his hair out where he sat on the floor of the long, white hallway. His face was red, puffy, and streaked with tears to match his tired eyes. He was blocking out the noises behind him, scared to hear them flatline.

"She's stable." Mary had tried to comfort him, knowing it wouldn't work. "She'll pull through on this one, yet."

He had thought that actually opening up and being honest with his daughter would help her. They had grown closer in the past two months, she had even begun to do better in school. He had agreed to let her graduate early if she qualified herself.

He wouldn't have found her if Mycroft wasn't keeping tabs on her. In fact, when he called, his brother had even sounded worried.



"

Sherlock, I've called an ambulance." Mycroft's voice was calm and steady. His younger brother's heart dropped. "She did lead us to a drug ring, it turned out that it was useful for us to tail her."



"

Where is she?" Sherlock felt nauseated. His head was spinning.



"

She's going to be in an ambulance in a few seconds, I've just arrived."



"

Is she breathing?"



"

Her heart might be beating." And something happened that he'd never really heard before, his brother's voice contained hints of fear. "They seem to think she can make it."



"

I'm coming."


"She looks sick." Sherlock whispered against the glass of the intensive care. John agreed, bags under his eyes.


"She looks like you. Curly hair, tubes, and all." His friend's voice sounded worse than his face looked. Neither of them had slept in two days, but Sherlock was used to that. "She'll pull through. They'll want to admit her, though."

"She won't like that."

"It won't be for long, I'm sure. It unfortunately never is." John reassured, somewhat. There was a pause. They hadn't spoken in two days either. John had tried, but Sherlock had remained silent. "Thank God for Mycroft."

"Yes." Sherlock breathed. "He called the ambulance in time. Any longer and she could have been dead."

"I know you don't want to hear it, but Jack is beaten up about it." Sherlock tensed. "He thinks it's his fault."

"It's mine." The dark haired man shook his head. "I should have been open sooner. I should have listened to Mary when she said she wouldn't fit in. I should have let Mycroft convince me. She was never meant to be where she is now."

"He wants to visit."

Sherlock shook his head, not even bothering to look up. If the young man wanted to suddenly re-express interest in his childhood friend, he could do it when she was not so delicate.

"I thought not." And Dr. John Watson stood up to go find some sort of sustenance for the both of them.



A/N - re-inspired. I had a discussion w my cousin about the episode last night. She settled down because Mary didn't last in the books. I kind of saw this coming but am still horrifically upset by it
