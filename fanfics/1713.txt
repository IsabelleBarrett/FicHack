


Hello there !



it's been a while. So here I am with a new chapter. If you did like the Badmington incident, you will really like what the three brother will do to Marco, but sadly, this chapter is not to translate before a good while.



For
Strong World,
you will see it shortly, just two more chapter before it. As for "Marine Ford"... or at last, Impel Down, there still seven chapters. So you know more or less what to expect.



So, enjoy this chapter and don't forget review !



An island.

Perfect. Shanks was on land.

Ann assured herself once more that her
Striker
was hidden correctly in the bushes, before arranging her black hat on her head and to extend her Haki to sense the presence of the pirates.

Her feet lead her in the wanted direction, her black coat swirling around her legs in her rapid walk, and soon, Benn was there to welcome her.

-Well,
Hime
, here's a strange visit. Simple courtesy or is there something else behind it? Benn smiled.

Seeing how Benn had insisted on the '
Hime'
, it could only mean one thing, and the
Haki
confirmed it easily: someone was listening.

-Heya Benn! I can't come see the old cabin boy of my otou-san and the crazy crew accompanying him, like that, without reason?! I'm hurt! Smiled Ann in a mocking voice.

-
Ann
…

-Pfff, you're not funny. You'll know when I will have seen Shanks-nii-san. Because, you see, it's been some days since I last rested my legs, so, I would like to
sit
, if you
allow
it.

Then she cut herself off, like taken by a bright idea.

She offered a smile to Benn.

This

smile. The one she mostly give Shanks, Rayleigh, Sabo, Luffy and the others commanders. Even if it was an honor to know that you are a part of such a selective club,

this

smile, wasn't always something good.

-Huuu, dada! Roared Ann in his ear.

Before the poor Benn could react, he had Ann on his back.

-Aren't you too old for this sort of thing? Grumbled Benn but without making her go down.

He began to walk toward the camp.

When a D. had an idea in his head, you couldn't do anything to make them change their mind.


The pirates stayed gobsmacked before the surprising entry of Ann on Benn's back, in their camp.

Shanks composed himself quickly and found himself rolling on the ground laughing.

-Okashira, please… sighed Benn as Ann jumped on the ground, happy to hear the pirates laugh.

With the Absolute Freedom, that was what she liked in the piracy.

The laugh was never far, even in the most serious situation. The Marine, it was a band of person so uptight that even a broom in the ass couldn't be an explanation enough for their stiffness and their lack of humor (except Garp, or Aokiji, and
even then
).

Not to herself… deprave the Kemuri-ossan. He seemed interesting, it would make him the biggest good to get rid of a little of his wrinkles. He would even maybe be able to change the Marine a little, make them… cooler.

Hey, if they wanted to continue to have recruits, they had to look cooler for the young!

-What brings you here, Ann-chan! Smiled Shanks holding her a bottle of Sake after having taken a gulp.

Ann accepted the bottle, thanking mentally Shanks' precaution.

A spy had tried to kill her, during one of her visits, poisoning her cup. Shanks had then decided to not let her drink any alcohol without testing it. He had more experience, and he recognized more easily than her when a drink was poisoned.

Also, Rayleigh would immediately kill him if something happened to Ann.

-Unfortunately, I'm not here with good news. Can we talk in private? You can tell whatevere you want to your crew later.

She took a second sip of alcohol before she gave the bottle to Benn.

-For the piggyback ride! She smiled.

-I don't know how you survived her father, but I admire that about you, Okashira, sighed Benn taking a sip, before throwing the bottle to Shanks.

Shanks gave him a huge grin as he stood up.

-The answer is easy… I was with Rayleigh-san! Let's go, Ann-chan!

He passed an arm around the miss' shoulder and they walked away.

Some moments later, they were sitting on some rocks, near a lake.

-So, I'm listening, what is it about for Shirohige to send you see me, Shanks asked smiling gently to the commander.

-Shiki.

The smile of Shanks took on a preoccupied air.

-He called Oyaji. He wants the throne of the Seas, stated Ann. Oyaji wanted for me to warn you.

-That's nothing new. He wants you to give it to him?

-Yeah, but he can always dream, I don't know the way to Raftell, and if I must see this island one day, I want to find it myself. But I'm scared for Lu'.

-What a lack of faith in your brother! I remind you that he razed Enies Lobby!

-No, he escaped a Buster Call, he didn't raze anything. He just ridiculed the Marine.

-You are being picky, it's not like you!

-No, I cleared something.

Shanks chuckled, and looked at Ann who had picked up a denden from her bag.

-I'm calling Oyaji, to know what I must do, now. Following what is said, I'll go back to Shabaody.

-I have some sake for Rayleigh-san and Shakky-san. You will give it to them for me?

-No problem!

- We're going back to the camp after your call.


Shanks stared smiling at the commander rolled into a ball between the roots of a tree. He took his cape from his shoulders and put it on the miss who moved in her sleep, but without waking up.

-Maybe it's time to think about a family, okashira, commented Ben in a very low voice when he saw him do that.

In the crew, he was the only one still sober (I won't go back on Shanks, we know we have to be worried if he is sober). The captain came to join his first mate, without looking away from the sleeping form.

-No, that's not for me. It just normal to take care of my little sister. Senshô did a lot for me. He was like a father, with Rayleigh-san. When I look at Ann, I see the ten years old fury, that I knew at Dawn. An adorable little fury, on who I allow myself to look upon from afar, like any good big brother.

-Will you tell her about all of those you killed that were after her?

-No, she would blame me, and tell me that I should have let her take care of it herself. I would do the same for Sabo and Luffy, it's not only because she is Roger's child… I am their big brother, to the three of them, it's my role, and I fulfill it with joy…

Shanks stiffened sensing two fingers against his temple, as Ann was letting herself fall beside him, his fingers still threatening against his red head.

-You will leave me my enemies, please, it's my problem, not yours, okay, Yonkou-san? Muttered Ann, with a slightly sleepy voice.

Shanks raised a hand in defeat, even if he didn't have the intent to do it.

-Interesting question… who from the Kaizoku Hime or the Yonkou is the highest ranked in the hierarchy of the piracy.

The other two looked at him with an idiotic look, and Ann sighed:

-Give me some sake, you're asking too complicated questions at an impossible hour. And tomorrow, I have to take the sea quickly to catch up with Thatch, Namur and Jozu. Trouble on the Gyojin island.

-Good luck, my dear, good luck, wished Benn as Shanks tried an alcohol.

The bottle passed from the red head to the black one who took a sip before she answered:

-For luck… you knock on the good door, my entire life is possible because of the good grace of the Lady Luck!


Thatch held an arms above the railing, and Ace closed his hand on it, to board the secondary ship that his float and two others were taking for Gyojin Island.

An evil smile and…

Splash!

Ace had succeed in throwing Thatch in the water, before using his power to get on the ship. Jozu and Namur looked with him at the show of the Yonbantaï Taïshou completely wet and disheveled, yelling threats and insult to Ace for having destroyed his pompadour.

-He is threatening you, I'm not dreaming, pointed Namur with sharky grin.

-That's right, assured Ace, smiling slightly.

-I wonder how Marco would react if he heard half of the quite… graphic threats, that Thatch just uttered… Jozu stated calmly.

Thatch closed his mouth and pouted. Namur threw him a rope, while Ace went to see his float.

-Ace, called Patrick before the pirates could go deeper into the ship.

-What is it? Inquired Ace.

He frowned seeing the dark expression of his friend. With a gesture of his head, the pirate indicated his superior to follow him, and he led the D. to the medical bay.

-Konnichiwa, Ace-Taïshou! Smiled Cassandra.

-Ohayô. You didn't stay with Oyaji? Asked a surprised Ace.

Despite his pleasant tone, he kept his distance with the woman. He didn't like to tempt the Devil.

Hearing the complains that she was muttering, Shirohige had insisted for her to accompany them.

-So, otherwise, what am I doing here? Inquired Ace.

The eyes of the nurse became sad. Patrick and her exchange a glance, and the blond went back to her desk.

-Act like I'm not here, she said.

-Oi…

-It's Edwin, announced Patrick.

Ace sensed his stomach knot itself.

He followed Patrick at the end of a row of bed, and stopped before the last one, occupied by his second. He had a bandage around his mouth, was pale, but in one piece, albeit lost in though.

-Ed… the Taishou is here.

Edwin jumped and looked at his commander. He offered a not so assured smile, that we only could guess behind the bandages and raise his hand as a greeting.

-What did you do, Edwin? Asked Ace. I have a bad feeling.

Edwin looked at Patrick who nodded.

-He was temporary captured for interrogation by the Marine. We didn't came fast enough to stop him from cutting his tongue off. We did succeed in coming on time to keep him from dying, however. You have to thanks Chris for this one.

Boom!

Edwin massaged his head when Ace's fist descend on it.

-Why did you do such a foolish thing, Edwin?! Your trust in your nakama is so low that you must use such a thing! K'ssou! Oyaji knows?

-Yes, stated Patrick.

-What was so urgent, mate, seriously? Asked Ace sitting on the end of the bed.

Edwin took a notebook on the bedside, with a pen. He found a blank page and began to write, before holding his notebook to his commander.

"They were asking questions on your link with 'Ann'."

Ace sighed.

-We already talked about it. You could have told them that she is my twin, it's what was arranged with everyone, if this question was asked.

The notebook disappeared from Ace's hands, to come back under his nose a little later with another message.

"I'm not Marshall. I don't betray my nakama so easily. We are a family. You have enough problems like that, it useless to add to them telling the Marine that you are the heir of the Kaizoku Ou."

Now, Ace didn't see what he could say. He sighed and put a hand on Edwin's shoulder with a poor smile.

-Thank you for wanting to protect me, Edwin. I'm touched.

He refrained from adding that it was useless and everything else, showing a surprising tact very rare for him. After all, his right hand man had scarified his tongue, almost dying too, to protect him. To scold him for that, it would be to insult his gesture, and to end their relation of trust and their friendship. He couldn't allow that.

The smile, which was a little pained, and the nod of Edwin squeezed Ace's heart, but he stayed smiling, to not show anything.

-I'm going to put my things away, take some rest. But don't even hope that it is a lack of tongue that will save you from your post, Edwin. To compensate, I could even increase your paperwork… Stated mischievously Ace standing up.

And he walked away, without seeing the expression of the second, but hearing the coughs coming from Patrick, slightly choking, which was probably choke on his laughter before Edwin's face the pirate probably didn't like the idea of doing more paperwork. Ace went to see Cassandra who raised her head from the paperwork.

-Oh, someone take some risk? She smiled, like a cat before a juicy bird, making Ace shiver.

Ace searched in his pocket, trying to stay calm and to not tremble. He posed two boxes
delicately
on the desk of the woman.

-I don't have any med anymore, can you do something for that, please?

The woman had a discrete laugh before the childish scared voice of the commander.

-If it's asked so nicely, she assured standing up, the boxes in hand.

She went toward the huge medicine cabinet which she opened with a key coming from her coat. The nurses weren't crazy. You shouldn't leave an easy access to this sort of stuff!

-Cassandra…

Cassandra turned toward Ace.

-Edwin…

-Don't worry, Taïshou. He will be alright. He should be able to quit the medical bay before we reach the Gyojin Island. Don't worry so much for him, you have already enough on your plate as it is.

-I'm a D., and a D. never has enough in his plate.

-Take that as a friendly advise! And here for you!

She put the boxes in Ace's hand, and four pills (two of each sorts) in his other hand. Ace put the boxes in his pocket and swallowed the pills. He took the glass of water that the woman was handing to him and swallowed it straight.

-Thanks a lot, he bowed giving her the glass back. With this, I'm going to retire, I must have some work waiting for me to do.

The woman pouted seeing her potential victim walk away and go out of the room, soon followed by Patrick. She sit at her desk sighing.

Too bad that Ace was gay. Such a merchandise under her eyes, almost everyday… you could only curse Marco… although he was also rather cute. Raah! What a wasted of good! That's what it was!

-Why are all the cute men gay?! She groaned.

Pouf.

She lowered her eyes to see a paper plane on her desk. She raised her eyes to see at the other side of the room Edwin signaling him to ope the plane. The woman unfold it and raised an eyebrow seeing the message:

"Try your luck with Thatch."

With slow and calculate moves, she stood from her desk and put on surgical gloves, a scary smile on her lips. She looked with an unhealthy pleasure the pirate curled in a ball clearly on his bed, with each step the woman was making toward him.

-Well, why don't we do a check up, while we are at it?! Said the woman with the devilish smirk.

Gulp.


Namur came back from his conversation with King Neptune with Jimbe and some paperwork. They arrived in the meeting room where Thatch, Ace and Jozu were already waiting.

-Hey, Jimbe! Greeted Ace and Thatch.

Jozu only nodded calmly.

-Hello everyone, greeted Jimbe. Oyaji-san want definitely to take care of this case, I guess.

-This island is under the protection of our crew, so, you know how it is… Thatch told him. Let's go on the serious business.

Namur unrolled the map of the island on the table, as Jozu took the paperwork to give it a glance.

-From what I see, we should be enough to complete the mission, it should be alright. Ace you are the highest ranking, it is your duty to decide of the tactic, Jozu said giving the paperwork to him.

-I love being the Nibantaï Taïshou, smiled Ace taking the papers.

Thatch only rolled his eyes with a thin smile on his lips.

Ace looked over the papers, and then at the map.

-Namur, I leave you the harbor, and take Jimbe. If the idiot sail before we caught them, and take back the mermaids, you will be our only mean to stop them. Meanwhile, ask your men to find and destroy their ships after making sure that there is no civil in it.

-I'm not a rookie, Ace, you know, sighed Namur.

-We are never too prudent.

-Ace-kun just said the word prudent? Wondered Jimbe.

The young man did a little pout, then referring to the file, pointed a point on the map.

-Thatch, it's your area. Have fun! When you're finished with it, you take care of this one.

He moved his finger on another zone.

-Yeah, I will have a lot of fun! Assured the cook with a maniacal smile.

-Jozu, I entrust you with these four zones, Ace put his finger on four points on the map, with two corresponding with Thatch's two zones, and protect the best you can the civilians, and evacuate those who were captured. If you have to, Namur, see with Jimbe if you can borrow some of his men, to send some of yours to help Jozu. Some fish men and mermaids near the water would be more useful than humans.

-I'll warn my men, assured Jimbe.

-I'll make sure that the people won't be taken in the fights, assured Jozu. I accept with pleasure the reinforcements.

-Me, I take the two others areas. These are the strategics points of this trade. Thatch and me, we will make a diversion, each on our side, while you save everyone, Jozu. Now, everyone to your post. As soon as the targets are visible, we are acting. If everything goes well, Namur, you won't really need to act. Some remarks?

-Except for thank you Rayleigh, no, smiled Namur.

Ace stuck his tongue to him and closed the file.

-Everyone to their post!

-Hai.


Ace woke up in a start for the second time of the night, and put a hand in his hair to slid them away from his face, trying to chase away the images of his nightmare.

Shaking his head, he pulled himself from his covers to rush to the shower.

Soon after he entered the kitchen, surprising Thatch who was making the breakfast.

-You, you fell from the bed, Is it that hard for you to sleep alone? Thatch said looking him over, without stopping from mixing a dough between his hands.

-I had two nightmare straight, what do you want me to tell you, mumbled Ace.

-Sit at the table, here, and wait a moment.

Ace did so and let himself fall on a chair. The cook finished what he was doing and washed his hands, before coming toward his friend with a fuming mug.

-Take that. And don't tell me you passed the age, there is no age to drink hot chocolate, his friend told him sitting with him.

Ace took the mug and took a sip, grateful.

-You want to talk about it, or you want to contact the main ship to talk with Marco? Asked Thatch.

-I had a nightmare about my brothers, that's all.

-I won't mock you, Ace, I know that it's a subject on which we can't laugh, even less with you.

Ace seemed to hesitate, and then posed the cup on the table to massage his neck. His friend let him take his time.

-In the first dream… I saw Luffy… he had just lost consciousness, after a fight. Seeing that he was smiling, I was sure he had won… then, there was a man who appeared and who decided to kill him.

-Who? Asked Thatch.

-Kuma. The Shishibukai. I don't know what happened, since I woke up the moment he was going to do it. I went back to sleep to drive in a second nightmare… about Sabo this time. I saw him being interrogate under torture… I was hearing his pained screams, and almost begging to be killed. I even wonder if they weren't going to kill him, with all this torture… and that's when I decided to not sleep anymore. I don't want to have another nightmare. Who would be next… Makino-nee-san? Ji-chan? Oyaji? Marco? You? Haruta? The list is too long…

-Ace… these are just bad dreams, you don't have to worry, no? Thatch smiled at him, to reassure him. You want to try to call them?

-Sabo leave his denden with Ji-chan, to not be localized on a mission. If he doesn't call me, I can't join him. And Luffy will make a scene, I'm sure.

Thatch stood up and quit the kitchen, to come back later with a denden mushi.

-Call Luffy, only that, to make sure about him, at least.

Ace sighed and took the denden.

During a moment, it rang, but didn't answer, making the commander put the receiver down.

-As soon as possible, I take Lu' by his ass, and embark him to make a Vivre Card, sighed Ace searching his protect-elbow.

He took out from it all the Vivre Card in his possession, and spread them on the table. He took one of the cards, who was beginning to self burn.

-Who it is? Asked Thatch frowning.

-Sabo, whispered Ace, so pale that his freckles almost disappeared from his face.
