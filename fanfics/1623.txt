

Percy walked through the borders of his old home, sighing loudly.


How long has it been? Thirty years? Forty?


Percy walked slowly, holding an enormous bouquet in one hand, and a ragged journal in the other.

He walked to every cabin, pausing at the door of each one, as if remembering fond experiences.

He opened the door of a few, as if to check if anyone remained.

He went inside the Athena cabin, and opened the journal to a picture of a young Annabeth.

He smiled as he placed the journal on her bunk.

He walked out wistfully, and began to place flowers on each of the graves.
