not a pretty little silk worm


I'm a different sort of breed. The sort that's warped and twisted because of the poison that's burnt my frail little worm stage:
your
poison. Not that pretty little silk worm you were hoping for – and you don't even notice it.

You'll see soon enough though; you'll see what those poisonous fingers have caught and bred. You'll see what your poisonous heart has made. And who knows? Maybe I could have been that pretty little silk worm for you, if you had been warmer, kinder, less like acid that seared my fragile skin and made me hide my bitter wounded heart in a premature shell. But it's too late now; you won't get any beauty from me, when I show my scabbed face to you.

Your acid's burnt that too: burnt everything, changed me utterly so I'm a moth that can't stand the bright light of the sun instead of the pretty butterfly you caught me for. But it's too late, and you can't change your mind now: you have me and you'll have to do with this poison moth when it emerges, with the powder that'll dust you and burn slow holes into you – as you did to me.
