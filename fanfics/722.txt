This story will have hardly anything to do with the actual film- I will simply be taking parts and a few characters and using them in my story. They will be OOC and I wouldn't recommend avid fans to read this fanfiction because Scut Farkus will be displayed in a completely different way to how his character is in the movie. The beginning is set during the movie and the rest is set years after. I guess it's more or less written in an alternate universe.

Basically:
Scut is completely OUT OF CHARACTER.
