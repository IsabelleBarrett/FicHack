Author's Note:
Ukitake x Unohana ~ Ukitake laments the loss of one of his oldest companions.


Old


Ukitake Juushirou stroked the long black hair of one of his oldest companions. He knew that they only had a little time left to each other. There was so much he wanted to tell her, but nothing came out of his mouth.

"What's on your mind?" her soft voice came as a whisper.

"That I should be going before you, Yachiru," the white haired captain replied.

A small smile blossomed on the woman's pale face. "I know my fate."

"Shunsui never should have asked you to do this. We still need you, especially with Sensei gone," insisted Ukitake.

"Isane and Kenpachi… they know all I know."

Ukitake closed his eyes, his jaw clenching tightly. She was so much more than an old friend or an old flame to him. As soon as he had felt her fading, he knew he had to go to her. He had been there to take her from Kenpachi as soon as their "training" was over.

"Do not be angry," she told him, lifting a hand to caress his cheek.

Ukitake sighed. "Never will I be angry with you," he told her.

"Good," she said, her eyes closing. Her hand fell from his cheek, leaving blood smears on his face.

Ukitake held in his anguish as best he could. Finally Unohana Retsu, the first Kenpachi, could rest without the burden she had carried for centuries. Ukitake closed his eyes and held her tighter, leaning over her to whisper, "Be at peace, my oldest love."
