.

I'm writing the next chapter RIGHT NOW but first I had to announce something!





My cousin's a musician and just got her first song on ITUNES!





anyone who buys it can PM me for a SNEAK PEAK into the next chapter!





just PM me and tell me the first line to the song so I know you bought it.





The song is called "Flashbacks" by Abby Glatt





THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH, this means the world to her(:
