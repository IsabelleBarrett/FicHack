

"Slap me." He said, not smiling this time. "Slap me."

"Why would I do that?" I ask, not knowing why
he
would ask that.

"Because I like it. Go on, slap me."

"This is so not you. Stop being
him
and be yourself!"

"And with 'him' you mean...?" He asks, coming up from the bed.

"Loki, yes. Be Tom." I say, putting the blanket over my now naked body.

Tom sits on top of me, laughing. "Scared?"

"Of Tom? No. Of Loki? Yes." I say, a little smile growing on my face.

"Are you going to slap me?" He asks.

"No. I didn't even know you are into that." I say, looking at his body. It's hard to focus when that's sitting on top of you. I mean, it is Tom Hiddleston for god's sake. "What's happened to Mister Sorry?"

"He's dead. And by the way, Loki is coming back on the screen and I need to get back into the character." He says.

"And this is how you come back into character? By having abusal sex?"

"Not always. If I have a girlfriend, yes."

I push him of me. "You won't be getting a slap, Hiddle."

"Ah, back to Hiddle. That means your angry. What's wrong?"

"Don't tell me you don't know what's wrong."

"You're mad because I want you to slap me?"

"Indeed."

"Well, I'm not responsible for this weird kink. You only told me yesterday you got horny when seeing
ducks
shag!"

"I told you to never say that again. I was drunk and we were playing Truth or Dare, you know that's a bad combination."

"You did tell it." He says, putting his arms around me.

I turn around and push him away. "No, no, no romantic evening tonight."

"Ah, babe, I'm sorry ok. But..." Tom's voice is cut off by my hand on his cheek.

"Now you got your slap, but don't think it was a kinky slap, mate."

"I know you don't mean it.' He says leaning in to kiss me.

"You know me to well."
