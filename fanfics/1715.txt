I'm sorry that I haven't updated this story in over a year. Don't worry I haven't abandoned it. Ideas still swim around in my head. I have just been busy with starting university and life in general. I have exams in 2 weeks. Here is some advice DON'T TAKE ENGINEERING :p I generally know where this fanfic is going and after the exams I will get back to it. I intend to edit any mistakes I have made so far and change some minor things also I intend to make each chapter longer in order to give more depth to the characters and to give characters like Oswell Whent and Gerold Hightower a more significant role. Where before it was mainly just Arthur Dayne, I want Oswell and Gerold to have their presence felt by the reader. But Arthur will still have a bigger role in the story than those two because I want to show his influence on Jon. For Jon in this universe looks up to Arthur, they have a relationship that's very similar to what a son would have with a father. Anyhow I want to thank all of you for the support and good luck to all of you who have exams.
