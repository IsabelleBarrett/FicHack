I was walking back home as per usual when I noticed a blue flower placed on my front doorstep. Tied to it with a royal blue ribbon was a little card.


The sea of ocean is coming near,



so do not fear.



Someone to admire



You inspire.



This blue rose is my gift



with a spell that no one can ever lift.



Take care of the rose.



And your whole life will change.


"Woah, everything rhymed except for the last two lines," I thought. I giggled, and put the rose up to my nose. It had a nice calming smell. "I wonder what will happen." I said aloud, before opening the door to the house and tossing my things aside, in order to get a vase. I filled the vase with water and placed the rose inside. Gathering my bag, I strode up to my room and place the rose next to my computer on my desk.

"This is such a rare rose. I wonder who gave it to me..." I said and I smiled.
