.

Magnus was completely flabbergasted. How could this have happened? One minute the young Shadowhunter was fumbling around on the lock. The next thing he saw was Alec being buried underneath a heap of books. He really hadn't expected that.

.

A groan came from underneath the book pile. It occurred to Magnus that he should probably help the boy. He snipped his fingers and made the books order themselves into piles in the centre of the room.

.

Alec soon showed up under all those books. He looked a bit startled, which was to be expected. He certainly hadn't seen a book avalanche coming when he opened the lock.

.

Magnus felt kind of bad for doubting the boy's abilities to open the shelf. "Are you okay? Are you hurt?" When the boy didn't answer Manus thought of a different way to get a reaction out of him. "You okay, blue eyes?"

.

Alec's eyes shot up and there was that adorable blush again whenever Magnus called him by his nickname.

.

Alec looked a bit dishevelled. "My head hurts a bit."

.

Magus touched the boy's forehead, which earned him another adorable blush.

.

He used his magic to check if everything was okay. It turned out to be nothing, which Magnus was rather thankful for. He wouldn't want to be the warlock to turn up at the New York Institute and tell Maryse Lightwood that he'd probably damaged her son. She'd decapitate him on the spot!

.

"So, you managed to open that lock for me, huh blue eyes? Who'd have thought?"

.

Alec looked extremely proud and grinned at the warlock. "I told you I could open it!" he boasted. He looked up at Magnus waiting for him to praise him.

.

Magnus smiled fondly at the little boy. He really was something. It made him sad that Hodge was training him to become a murder machine. That little boy would probably never look at him like that ever again. He'd probably hate Magnus years from now and regret ever having spent time with the warlock.

.

Magnus smiled at the blue-eyed boy. "Thank you. That was rather clever of you. I wouldn't have thought of that myself. I have to give you that little Shadowhunter. "

.

Alec grinned from ear to ear. He was completely satisfied with himself that much was certain.

.

In that instance, Magnus really didn't want to go home alone. He had the sudden urge to take the boy with him and show him that a warlock could be fun and not just a threat that you'd have to extinguish.

.

Slowly Magnus bent down and stopped in front of Alec lips. The boy had turned into the colour of a tomato within a split second and Magnus could hear his blood pumping through his veins faster and faster.

.

"Tell you what darling. You come with me to turn the snowstorm off in my apartment and then we'll settle that debt between us."

.

Alec could just nod silently. He had been genuinely happy about opening the lock. He had completely forgotten about the bet. It was completely uncharacteristic for him to act that spontaneous and childish to make a bet in the first place. That was usually his sister's area of expertise.

.

Somehow Alec had the feeling that this warlock had a very bad influence on him but he just couldn't help himself. He was just fascinated by Magnus.

.

Meanwhile Magnus was convinced that he'd show the boy a good time and that not all Downworlders had to be a threat. He just hoped he wouldn't run into any other colleagues. Most of them all ready thought that he was much too lenient with the Shadowhunters. He didn't really need anybody to question his authority. He'd just have to steer clear of any possible Downworlders hangouts so that nobody would notice him and the little murder machine.

.

He was sure that although Alec may look cute and harmless he was already not a foe to mess with. However, Magnus had a hard time imagining Alec hurting anybody. He couldn't even picture the kid in gear or with a weapon. Though as a grown up Alec would surly look hot in Shadowhunter gear.

.

Magnus shook his head. He had no idea were these thoughts were coming from and he desperately wished somebody would hit him over the head to get them out of his mind.


It's been a while since I updated this story but I haven't abandoned it.
