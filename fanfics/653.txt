A Letter From A Strange Place Part 1



One wintery Saturday morning, Richard, the Chan family's butler went out to check the mail.



Rosa &amp; Charlie Chan were the only members of the family who were awake because it was five o'clock in the morning.



"The mail is here, Master &amp; Missus Chan." Richard said.



Richard handed the mail off to Rosa &amp; Charlie.



Charlie sifted through the mail until he found a mysterious letter.



"What's that, Charlie?" Rosa asked now interested in the letter.



"It's a letter for my late wife, apparently," Charlie answered Rosa. "I'll wait for the children to wake up before I read it."



"Good idea, Charlie." Rosa replied.
