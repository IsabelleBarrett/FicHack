hello eveeyone. I'm happy so many of you like the story and I'm happy you guys/gals want a second one. I will oblige and write the next one if y'all want. From what I've been reading the small fandom does want another.

For those of y'all who are guests please note that I do read EVERY review that I'm given on all stories. If you are trying to give me your email to contact you, please note I would but has this weird thing where u can't give someone your email. Don't believe me? Check some of the reviews.

Because of that if you wish to contact me please note the following ways:

KIK. username- Kablamstar

TWITTER. username- Kablamstar

EMAIL. Kablamstar at Gmail Dot Com

XBOX. Username- Kablamstar.

All of these are approved ways to contact me. I'll talk to y'all later.
