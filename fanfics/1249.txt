But anyway, I found this old project that was made to use figurative language found in books of our choosing. And so, I just thought about sharing it with you all, and here we are. As a side note, this was made in 6th grade, so forgive my cheesiness/immaturity found in this. Without further ado, let the poem begin.





The Sniper of Mother Russia



By [Redacted]

Note: This story was inspired by [Redacted], so kudos to him.

Red words are my Inner thoughts

Blue words are my Inner self talking

Black words are the experiences itself.


The brittle stems



of last years foliage



pricked my palms



as I inched forward



like a ghost



to gain a more



strategic view of



Stalingrad,



which loomed over



The wintery lands



like an impenetrable fortress



in the



Sub zero landscape



The bright powerful moon



gave me all of the light



I needed to snipe those



disgusting animals



As I saw



Russian



after



Russian,



family member



After



family member



die at the hands



and bullets of these



horrific and arrogant Nazis,



I was filled with a



rage so terrifying,



that all



cower before it.



As we closed in our target,



One general Amsel,



we moved



Slowly



Like tendrils of



water seeping



Through sand



We move



We shoot



We run



We snipe



We bring down planes



with artillery



We destroy tanks



with our rockets



We move in



On our



Target



and his bodyguards.



A terribly thick amount of



ghostly mist,



gray and



deathly looking



emanated from the



pale water,



as if



witch fire burned



the surface of the water.



No matter.



No matter.



We still could not sleep.



My entire team,



full of



medics,



snipers,



mortar men,



gunnery sergeants,



Even



Comissionar Markov



And



Legendary Sniper



Vasily Zaitsev



none of us could sleep.



We all lay there,



silent as a wraith.



The birds would not sing



The crows would not caw



The owls would not hoot



The tanks refused to fire



The planes would not fly



The people would not fire,



or talk,



or even make a sound.



All was still.



It seemed as if a magician



had placed an enchantment



upon the earth



and that everything in the



world was bound in



an eternal sleep



and would remain frozen



and unchanging



forevermore



underneath the



watchful gaze of the



twinkling stars.



Finally,



we all fell asleep.



A fan of golden light



flared into existence



as the top of the sun



crested the horizon.



In an instant,



the full spectrum of



colors enlivened



the previously



drab world.



The mist glowed white,



the water became a deep rich blue,



the snow even began to melt a bit



Stalingrad



remained as always though-



an ancient,



powerful city.




Now,





Time to close in for the kill.




Crack!



This PTRS-41



is really quite useful.



Unfortunately it's made



by the Germans.



Too bad,



it's my



weapon



of choice.



We had dispatched of a



7 squads. One person



escaped though.



Oh well.



We killed our way through



the heavily defended compound,



and finally,



I got to stab that



pathetic Amsel.



He even begged for his life,



Even as I locked dead eyes with him,



and brought the



Fairburn Commando Knife



to his throat,



To slit it.



My vengeance



wasn't sated though.



I wanted to



keep killing,



keep murdering these,



Animals,



until the Nazis were



wiped out.



But then,



Sniper Vasily Zaitsev came in.


"
We've got incoming



German Tank Divisions!"



Wait.



DIVISIONS?!



Good,



They shall burn in hell.



As Reznof watched over the carnage created by the team led by Vasily, he looked towards Dimitri, with a look of admiration present on his face.


"
This is true might Dimitri. The true might of Mother Russia. As long as you and squad Ghost remain alive, the drive of us will never falter, and never fail. Things will change my friend. We will take Berlin, and burn it to the ground!"



As I saw these pitiful Nazis



struggle on the ground,



Trying to get away from



the might of our



proud army,



trying to



stay alive,



I still did not feel pity.



In fact,



I felt joy.



I walked to one, and leveled a Walter P-38 at his head.



He stopped struggling



and stared at me.



He muttered



some curse



under his breath,



and



he spat at me.



It did not end well



for him.




Why must it end like this?





Why must we fight?





Why must I kill





Nazi after Nazi?





Is that all my life is now?





To kill every Nazi I see because the generals order us to?





To hurt people?



"

No, it is





Because they





killed,





tortured,





raped,





marauded,





and did horrible things





throughout





our motherland.





They even killed our family."





My inner self said.




For our grandparents



For our parents



For our loving sisters



For our relatives



For the Mother

land



Now



You may rest



In Peace



Tania Chernova




It always ends this way.




Always.
