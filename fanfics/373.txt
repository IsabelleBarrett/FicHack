


Click



The poem of a lone survivor.



A heart beat fluttering,

In my chest.

My blood throbbing in my veins,

Silence at its best.

One step, two steps,

Four steps five,

Careful where I move,

I may die.

Breath in my throat,

Lungs feel cut.

Nerves on end,

Eyes wide shut.

Goosebumps,

Crawling.

Infected,

Gnawing.

Clambering nearer,

Smashing, bashing,

Losing sight,

Before crashing.

Pistol in hand,

Dare to step closer,

See them attracted,

By embers still in smolder.

Click click bang!

Click click bang!

Here comes one,

Slow and plain.

Click click click click,

Click click click.

Move back one step,

Snap a stick.

In my ears,

My heart beats loudly,

Fear drains through me,

My stomach so rowdy.

Click click click click,

Click click click.

It's all done,

Can't be fixed.

One step,

Wrong step,

Should've looked,

Where I crept.

A costly mistake,

I have made.

Looks like I've,

Dug my grave.

Click click click click,

Click click click.

Attracted they are,

By the breaking of the stick.

Flocking, surrounding,

My back in a corner,

They draw nearer,

Attacking me the loner.

Boom shot, boom shot,

Boom boom shot.

They over power me,

No matter how I fought.

Blood throbbing to the floor,

Heart finally stilled.

The only thing I did,

Was keep the clickers filled.

Click click click click,

Click click click.

Click click click click,

Click click click.


Just a little thought I had. I'm welcome to requests.
