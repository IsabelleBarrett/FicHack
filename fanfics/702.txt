Foremost, I want to say a hearty and full blown thank you to my readers who have arrived to the conclusion of our adventure. Yes, this seems to be the end. Miles has fallen and he can't get up. He has endured many hardships, but it seems he had resigned himself to the very end to find the liberation he deserved from that god awful place. Or did he?

A few peeps have asked if I planned to novelize the Outlast Whistle Blower. This sounds like a fantastical idea, even if the ending of Whistleblower is as heart wrenching as Outlast. I'd fear misinterpreting Weylon's character, and generate a story that is an Outlast rehash and rewrite. But I've had a few ideas of Weylon's character, and we seem to begin the game from the point Miles Upshur left off. Filled with static and subjected to Morphogenic treatment, yet still struggling to retain what little pieces of his sanity remain. I can work with this.

But I also look to sign up for a class in the summer to help catch me up with school, and there's the aspect of job hunting. I've never been good with job hunting.

Once more a hurrah to my readers for their reviews, and those quiet lurkers that throw down a fav. It means the world to me that I was able to give something back to the fandom. Have a wonderful summer, and stay out of those abandon asylums and open windows.
