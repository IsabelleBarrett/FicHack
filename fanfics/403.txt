I sat in AP English, taking notes on our discussion on
The Great Gatsby.
Linden was very active in the discussion, providing great insight on the various themes. Mrs. Teel could hardly keep up.

"Linden, when did you read this book?"she asked.

"About two years ago, ma'am."Linden replied. Most of the people laughed but I just stared at her. She was beautiful and smart. She blushed and went back to the book she was reading.

"Hello Lady Linden."I said, sitting next to her again. She smiled and waved, food in her mouth.

"So, how's drama going?"I asked, knowing that she was a big part of the small drama club.

"We're trying to decide what play we should do. We should be having tryouts soon."she said happily. I smiled.

"I'm actually trying to find boys to take some more important parts."she said, looking at me. I gulped.

"Well, as long as it doesn't interfere with tennis, I could try out I guess."I said, thinking about it. She smiled a big smile and blushed. Yep. It made her happy, so I was doing it.

"Awesome! Thank you sooooo much. We really need it."she said, writing my name down on a piece of paper. I noticed a couple of other boys. Mostly basketball players. They were probably doing it as a prank. Then, I smiled at my wicked idea.

"Put Asher's name down too. He'll never admit it but he has a great singing voice."I told her. She giggled when I winked at her, letting her know that this was a joke. But, she did put his name down. We then ate lunch in silence.

"Soooo, Aspen...I have two tickets to see 'Grease' at Marigold Academy this Friday and...well, my dads busy that day soooooo...would you like to go with me?"she asked, timidly. I smiled.

"I would be honored too."I said, turning on my Southern charm.

"Great."she replied as I stared at her.

"It's a date."I said, as we left the lunch room. I high fived Falcon as I entered the gym. Mission accomplished.
