Do you ever think to look behind you on a bright, sunny day? Any typical one would do. No one's following you, no one's out to hurt you. It's silly to think that there's something bad out there to get you. They aren't as bad in the sense that they willingly want to hurt you, but they do constantly follow you around. Fuelled by one thing and one thing alone, they swim around wherever the light cannot reach them, constantly in need to eat something.

But in all cases of life, they are still patient.

They wait in the darkness. They are the darkness. They watch with invisible eyes, their invisible mouths filled with invisible teeth. You can't see them. No one can. That is, until you look under you on a bright sunny day. They're always there, following you, watching you, mimicking your every move. Though insatiable, they will always have the patience to wait.

Even as I type, they follow my movements.

They're everywhere, clinging onto whatever darkness they can find. So if you think that sitting in the dark, underneath the blankets to hide from the creatures that make you forget or kill you whenever you blink, think about what lurks in the darkness itself. Think about what creatures make up the darkness. Think about your shadow that follows you wherever you go. Walking, talking, moving with you until your deathbed, until you're dead and buried. Then their patience is rewarded.
