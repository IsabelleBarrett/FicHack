"Ronnie? Are you quite alright?" William asked, looking at me with a concerned expression.
"Huh? Uh, yeah, I'm fine" I insisted, forcing a smile.
Another low rumble sounded and I tensed, starting to feel nervous. "D-did you hear that?"
"Hm? Oh, yes. It sounds like the bin men"
I stood up and went over to the window, breathing out a sigh of relief when I saw the bin men's lorry.
"You were right. Whoops" I flopped back down next to him on the sofa.
"I'm always right" he said, pulling me close and switching on the telly. "Allow me to check the news"
I rested my head against his chest, bearing with it.

I got bored and stood up, going out into the kitchen and starting on a macaroni cheese.
"Seems we'll be getting a storm tonight"
I poked my head round the door. "A storm?"
William nodded. "Quite a bad one by the sounds of it"
I returned to the cooking, trying not to think about that.
"Will?" I called. "Are you staying tonight?"
"If I am allowed"
"You're allowed"

Will always had a way of making me feel so much safer. He was staying again, which I was glad of, yet nervous at the same time. We sat together to eat and before long, it was dark outside. That was when I sensed it starting. I stood up, starting for the living room door.
"Are you alright, Ronald?"
"Yeah, I just, I'm gonna-" There was a loud crash of thunder and I squeaked, rushing to my room and burrowing down under the covers, trying to block it out.
