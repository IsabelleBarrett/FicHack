Years passed in the town of Halloween. Santa had long ago returned to Christmas Town and Jack was happy. You would never see him without his patented ghoulish grin, but then, something changed. He stopped smiling, he stopped going out, and he even stopped talking to Sally.


The Day Before Halloween



"Jack? Jack, I'm going to go for a walk. Do you want to join me?" Sally leaned down and saw Jack's eyes unfocused, as he stared at the book he was 'reading'. "Jack?"

He waved a dismissing hand and Sally stood up straight and walked to the table. She grabbed her spool of thread and tucked it into her dress. She saw a glow of red at Jack's feet.

"Zero, would you like to go for a walk?" Her only answer was a ghostly whimper.

"Fine," She went to the door and looked at the inconsolable Pumpkin King, "Goodbye Jack."

Then she was gone.

Literally, she was gone.

The Pumpkin King stood angrily at his desk.
Where did she go?!


He slammed his fist onto the hard wood when another ghoul came to say she wasn't where
they
had looked.

He glared at everyone, and then patted his leg to call Zero. "I am going out to look again."

The Mayor's head swiveled revealing the hysterical side to the politician. "But, Jack, we can't
afford
to lose you too!"

Jack sneered at them as he left the house. "That's the best way to find something that's lost!" Then he was gone.
