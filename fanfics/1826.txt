

"Don't do it!" Yelled Sho staring at me like I was mad.

Malice had a gun aimed to her head,tired of her life here on Earth.

"AND WHY NOT!" Yelled Malice tears escaping from her eyes.

"You have so much to live for!" said Sho

Malice stared at him vaguely.

"You know-Kei can...Turn you into a.." Sho paused at this moment.

"I know-then...take me to him.."

Malice shot herself,A loud boom was heard a small scream,agony then nothing.

Sho walked over to her body,picking it up as he walked back to their house.

Kei was waiting there,for Sho.

"What happened to Malice!" Kei said running over as quickly as he could.

"She-She committed suicide..."Said Sho his lips quivering.

Kei sighed deeply and the room went silent for a minute.

He then picked up the body taking it into a room

"Give me an hour or two" Said kei.

Kei layed Malice on a table walking over and closing the door.

His fangs stuck out as he bit Malice on the neck being carefull not to "Kill her."

After a table was a bloody mess.

Kei wiped the blood from his mouth,walking outside the room.

"A-And?" Said the anxious Sho

"Shes alive...But she may be...A monster.."

Sho's eyes grew wide at this moment.

"A monster..." He concluded.
