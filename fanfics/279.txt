What if you found out that everything you believe was wrong? Every fiber of it? From the time you're born til' the day you die. I didn't have a mom and dad to teach me the morals everyone else knows, just my grandpa. He taught me that I was special, and that I could use my powers for good and protect the ones that I love. I never knew that I would be more important than I could imagine; but at a price. I, no we, are the chosen few of the Viridian Forest that possess the capabilities to lead the human race into centuries of peace, or extinction. I always thought i had a greater purpose, but not in this way.


It was a fairly sunny day, the cliche kind you see in movies. The blonde healer was just about ready for her first, and last date with Kanto Pokemon Champion, Red.

" Do I look good?" She asked, twirling around.

"Pika!" Chuchu said in agreement. She ran up Yellow's shoulder and handed her something. A necklace with a yellow crystal. Yellow looked puzzled at first, but put it on gingerly.

"Okay, Lets go!" She said opening the door, breathing the fresh summer air, and started to make her way down do Pokemon Square in Viridian, her hometown.

Little Did she know that this would be one of the last times she ever got to see the raven haired Champion.
