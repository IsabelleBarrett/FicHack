As you probably saw above I am coming back with a sequel! Yes a sequel where all of your questions will be answered, will Tris and Tobias ever escape their fathers? Will Caleb ever be exposed? How will Christina and Will and the rest of the gang react when they find out? Find out in my new story entitled, When will this end?

NOTE: I want to thank you all for believing in me and staying so faithful to this story, I want to give a special shout out to Q in the moment, for her review. I appreciate that so so much, you really gave me the push I needed to do this so you all have her to thank. Of course I appreciate all of your feedback, every review I got I would just think "Be patient! Theres more to come!" But really it means the world to me that you all are so devoted to the story and care so much about it :)

Okay one last thing, I want your ideas, please! Let me know what you want to see! Some of you have already and I plan to use some of them in the sequel and I really want to know what you guys would like to happen so just throw some ideas out there, it cant hurt. I cant promise to use all of them but I will definitely consider each and every one. Thank you for being such amazing readers and supporters, stay tuned :)
