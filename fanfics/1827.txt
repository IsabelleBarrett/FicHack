

Kei carried Malice to her bedroom.

The Vampire covered her up with blankets setting a glass of blood beside her. Just in case.

Sho looked anxious at Kei. "Will she be OK?!"

Kei sighed and sat on the sofa turning on the TV. "I give it a 3/5 chance she will be."

Sho sat beside him,Fiddling with his pistol.

"So-What happened...when.." Said Kei staring at Sho.

"Well..." He said "We were caught in a gang war.. with the Hashnima clan.."

He paused for a moment

"I told Malice to stay with me...Well...Stick together."

"She refused"

Kei spoke up and sighed

"You could have stopped her-"

"BUT I COULDN'T!" Yelled Sho.

"SHe was already GONE WHEN I SAID THAT!"

Sho's blood was boiling,His hatred rising to max.

Kei leaned back and looked at the Tv.

"Resume." Said the vampire.

"I heared several gunshots,then screams." "She accidentally shot...Her sister.."

Kei noded.

"She couldn't bear the thought and commited suicide"

They sat there in silence for a few minutes.

Suddenly they heared a scream then the words "BLOOD."
