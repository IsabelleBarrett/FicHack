
This is a song fic, for Skulduggery Pleasant, Valduggery obviously. she's always a woman to me by Billy Joel
Skul's POV
Her smile, i love it, and those eyes, twinkleing crystals, and hair as black as night. I may be over a hundread years older than her but she's always a woman to me. she never gives up she's a fighter but Darquesse is in her so she'll carelessly cut me and laugh as she watches me squirm. When she was fletcher's girlfriend i have to say i hated him for it he could kiss her and hug her. Be more than a friend i would always just be the friend
AN: so what do you think of my first fanfic chapter r+r i know it's short but little time, little writing
