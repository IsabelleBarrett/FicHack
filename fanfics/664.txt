Been working on a pair of novels, as well as trying to assimilate into a new job and life. However, I miss Miss Mary, and I miss the boys. Now, I don't have time to sit down and painstakingly watch the episodes of Sherlock. However, I still have my old plot notes, so I have something to go off of. It'll be a bit different, but bear with me as I get this story to where I want it to be. I'm happy to be back, you guys :] and I hope you enjoy what I bring!
