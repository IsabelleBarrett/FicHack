Four. I love Brother Bonding. And five. My mind is strange. So lets get on with it! Based off of Leos, "What's with Mr. Blabenport?" and his " I'll never trust you again," comments. Disclaimer: Y'all know I don't own Lab Rats.


Adam POV

I hate school. Well, not actually the school, just Perry, teachers, the homework, and waking up. Oh, and also Trent and his gang. They're the worst! Lucky, Bree and I get left alone for the most part. Normal sized, brown hair, brown eyes, we blend in. Are part of the crowd. Too bad I can't say the same for Chase and Leo. Short, smart, and friendless, they make easy targets. Principal Perry doesn't do anything, and it really pisses me off. They take beatings and insult right under her nose, and she's oblivious to it all. Ya know, I think she realizes it, but just doesn't care. The worst part is they won't open up to us, and it hurts. Sure, Leos starting to take action, but I want to be there for Chase. I am his older brother.

Snapping out of my daydream, I make my way towards my locker. Another Friday under the belt. Spotting Bree and Chase, we walk to the doors, pausing for Leo. Most of the school had already cleared out, where was he? Suddenly, we see him, dragging an overflowing bookbag with great struggle. Gasping and wheezing, he makes his way to us. We rush up to him, me taking his bag, Bree and Chase helping him up, for he had fallen. I shoulder his bag, and we make our way out of the school.


The first chapter is kind of a filler, sorry its so short. The next one will be longer. Later!
