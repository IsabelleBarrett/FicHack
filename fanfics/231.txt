Why do I always gotta get so fucking emotional about shit like this?

…I ain't gonna do it…I ain't gonna fucking cry in front of Leo like some big ass baby…I'll be damned if I let a single tear slip out. I'm almost seventeen years old already. That's too fucking old to be crying. After all the loss and fear I've lived through I sure as shit ain't gonna break down just because Leo hurt my damn feelings.

Man the hell up already, Raph.

Why did it get so damn quiet in here all of a sudden? I can't believe that great Fearless Leader would ever run out of things to say. His mouth is bigger than Mikey's.

Fuck. He's staring at me like I got horns growing outta my head. I hope ta hell he didn't notice me getting all misty-eyed. And if he did, I hope he at least has the decency to not make some stupid fucking comment about it.

I can't even look at him anymore.

Geezus, I need to get outta this room …I hate being locked in here...I need some fresh air…I need to get away…away from Leo and that damn judgmental stare of his…


…is that really how you feel, Raph...?


No, you idiot! I was fucking joking! Thought we could use a laugh! Ha! Ain't I funny?


…you think I'm lying?


I think you say what you think I want to hear. I think you say what you think is the right thing to say, what you think the perfect leader would say.


What do I have to do to get you to believe that I'm telling the truth?


See? There you go again.


Raph…please…talk to me…


…alright, Leo. You shut up for five minutes and I'll talk to you. Don't say a single word. Don't even make a sound. Just stand there and listen.
