Paris – Arthur/Gwen – G


He was from London. She was from Chicago. They met in Paris.

They quickly changed their vacation plans to spend all their time together.

They parted ways tearfully, promising to keep in touch.

They did. For a while.

Then, his communications stopped. She was heartbroken.

A week later, there was a knock at her door. Still nursing her heartbreak, she answered, wearing pajamas, hair in a ponytail, no makeup.

He stood in her doorway, fully dressed, but looking equally miserable.

"I cannot be without you."

"I've missed you."

"I could not live there while my heart is here."

"You stopped writing."

"I was packing for my move. Surprise?"

A hopeful look.

Lips crashed against lips, hungry and passionate, lips too long denied their mates. The nosy neighbor stared, clucking disapprovingly, as he was pulled inside, dragging his suitcase behind him.

Her apartment was sparse and full of boxes.

"Are you moving?"

"Um, yes. To Paris. Paris, Texas."

He smiled.

"Well, then. I guess we'll always have Paris, won't we?"
