Chapter 1: The Call


Pacey walked into his house after a long day at school. Tomorrow was prom and after the way his week have been going he was not up to for it. The week started off good but Wednesday came and all of went to hell. Since then all I could focus on was this one phone call in between the acting as if everything was normal around Joey and the gang and my mind I am exhausted. Living with Gretchen gives me a lot of time to myself, since lately spends all her time with Dawson. I should tell her soon, just in case everything is not okay as I am hoping it will be.

Ring…ring…ring

I jumped when the phone rung bringing me out of my thoughts. I walked to the phone and picked it up "Hello?"

"Hi, I am calling to speak to a Mr. Pacey Witter" the man on the other end said.

"This is he" I said a little hesitantly because this could be the call I've been dreading.

"Hi, this is Dr. Avery and we will like for you to come in later on today so we can run more test…"

"Why, is there a problem?" I ask beginning to freak out. Gretchen chose that moment to walk in the backdoor. She looked up at me and instantly begun to worry.

"What's wrong…?" she started before I hushed her.

"We just want to be accurate and we will like for you to bring someone in with you to drive you home…" he continue to talk but the phone slowly begin to fall out of my hands because if they was running more test it means they found something bad. Right? This can't be happening. I vaguely see Gretchen grab the phone and speak to the doctor. I wanted to yell No and tell her to hang up but I slowly start to lose consciousness. Everything went black.
