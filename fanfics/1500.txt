Jareth's Hobby



Jareth was really the unsuspecting victim in all of this. If only Toby hadn't found them, his secret would have been safe for all of eternity! But sadly, here he was, the goblin king, being heldup backstage at a concert by none other that his lovely queen.

The aforementioned woman was starting to wheeze from laughing so hard, and /he was completely mortified, nervously messing with his now short hair.

"Oh my god," She wheezed, somehow still giggling. "I knew he looked like you, but I never thought-" She burst into another bout of hysteria.

"You're David Bowie," Toby whispered in awe. "My sister is married to David freaking Bowie."

"Let's just go home," The blonde fae begged, already twirling a crystal nervously in one hand.

"A-alright," she stuttered, finally regaining her composure after a short muttered argument with what was likely her own mind.

As they vanished in an odd swirl of glitter, Sarah gave him a devilish smile.

"Now I know exactly how to convince my dad to be a little more polite when we come to visit." She checked her nails as the throne room materialized around him.

"He's your biggest fan."



Yes, it's short and drabble-y, but It's better than nothing. Have a nice night everyone.
