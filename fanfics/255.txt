

About 2 hours went by since Shawn and Juliet arrived at the hospital.

The doctor knocked on the door to see if Juliet progressed any. The doctor came in and greeted the couple and to check on Juliet and the baby.

"Well Juliet you have progressed a lot since you got here." the doctor said.

"How far along is she?" Shawn asked.

"She is about 8cm dilated should be another 1 ½ hours." the doctor said.

Shawn looked at Juliet and nodded.

"Thank you so much." Juliet said.

"No problem at all." the doctor said.

"Are you ready Jules?" Shawn asked.

Juliet looked into his eyes and said, "Ready as I'll ever be."

"Do you want me to call your parents or wait until after he is born?" Shawn asked.

"Do you mind if we call them after he is born?" Juliet asked.

Shawn shook his head.

"I am going down to the cafeteria do you want anything?" Shawn asked.

"Nope. I believe I'm good." Juliet answered.

"I will be back in like 5 minutes tops." Shawn said.

Shawn went down to the cafeteria and got him some food and went back upstairs to go be with Juliet.

"Hey, how are you feeling?" Shawn asked.

"Good. My water just broke Shawn. Go get the doctor please." Juliet said.

Shawn went to go get the doctor.

The doctor followed Shawn into their room and the doctor said, "How are you feeling Juliet?"

"I feel fine, but in a crap load of pain." Juliet said.

"Well you are ready to have this baby now." the doctor said.

"Shawn please go get me some ice chips." Juliet said.

Shawn went to go get some ice chips and came back in record time. Shawn got back to the room and handed Juliet her ice chips and went by her side to hold her hand.

"Do not get offended when and if I start yelling at you. It is just because of this ridiculous pain I am having." Juliet said.

"Alright. Take my hand." Shawn said.

Juliet took his hand and squeezed it with all of her strength for the first push.

"Good job Juliet. Keep doing that." the doctor said.

Shawn bent down to kiss Juliet on the top of her head.

"Ok Juliet, one more push and you two will have a healthy little baby here." the doctor said.

Juliet gave one more strong push nearly breaking Shawn's hand.

"It's a boy!" the doctor exclaimed.

As soon as Juliet and Shawn heard that first cry Shawn saw a tear running down Juliet's face and didn't notice he let tear go also.

Shawn bent down and wiped the tear from her face and said, "Good job baby. I love you."

"Dad would you like to cut the cord?" the doctor asked.

Shawn nodded and cut the cord where she told him to and then wrapped the baby up and put him in Shawn's arms to give to Juliet. Shawn handed Juliet the baby.

"Welcome to the world Aaron Michael Spencer." Juliet said.

"Would you like for me to take him and get him cleaned up for you guys?" the doctor asked.

Juliet nodded and handed the baby over to the doctor to get him cleaned up.

The doctor came back and said, "He is a happy and healthy baby boy weighing in at 7 ½ pounds and 10 oz. and 19 inches. Born at 7:30 in the morning." the doctor told them.

Shawn smiled and though that is the perfect baby.

"You did it Jules." Shawn said.

"Yeah, but I had you right by my side for the whole thing." Juliet smiled.

The doctor came back in and had the baby in the little crib.

"He is beautiful you guys. Congratulations." the doctor told them.

"Thank you." Shawn and Juliet said in unison.

"Do you want me to call everyone or let you sleep?" Shawn asked.

"Why don't you go ahead and call them?" Juliet said.

Shawn nodded and went out in the hall to call everyone.

It was about 30 minutes until everyone got there so Juliet got a little cat nap in.

Gus and Rachel were the first ones to show up.

"Man, how do you feel being a dad and all now?" Gus asked.

"I know! This is crazy and to answer your question it actually feels pretty good." Shawn said.

"Hey Gus and Rachel." Juliet said.

"Congratulations." Rachel said.

"Thank you so much." Juliet said.

"What's his name?" Gus asked.

"Aaron Michael Spencer." Shawn said.

"I like it." Gus said.

"Do you want to hold him Gus?" Juliet asked.

Gus nodded and went to sit on the couch next to Rachel.

"God Shawn, this kid looks just like you." Rachel said.

Shawn smiled and looked up and winked at Juliet.

"I hope he doesn't act like me though." Shawn said.

They all chuckled.

Gus and Rachel left.

Shawn got in the bed with Juliet and the baby so he could have some kangaroo time with daddy.

Next to arrive were Juliet's and Shawn's parents.

Shawn got out of bed with Juliet and handed Aaron to Juliet.

"Hey pop." Shawn said.

Hey son. Wow he looks just like you." Henry pointed out.

Shawn nodded and said, "Hey mom. How are you doing?"

"Good. He is beautiful guys." Maddie said.

"Want to hold him?" Shawn asked.

"Yes!" Maddie said.

Shawn gave him to Maddie and she sat down next to Henry on the couch.

"What is his name?" Henry asked.

"Aaron Michael Spencer." Juliet said.

"I like that. Who came up with that?" Maddie asked.

"Shawn did all by himself." Juliet said.

Maddie handed Aaron to Henry to hold and got up to give Shawn and Juliet a hug.

"Very happy for you Goose." Maddie said.

"Thanks mom." Shawn said.

Juliet's parents only stopped by for like a minute or so to say congrats and then left for a thing they had to go to.

The last ones to get there were the chief and Lassie.

"Hey guys come on in." Shawn said getting up from the couch and greeting them.

"Congrats Spencer and O'Hara." Lassiter said.

"Carlton how many times have I told you that it is Spencer?" Juliet asked.

Carlton just stood there in silence.

"What's his name?" Karen asked.

"Aaron Michael Spencer." Shawn said.

"I like that name. He looks just like you Shawn." Karen said.

"I know my mom and dad told me that." Shawn laughed.

The chief went over to talk to Juliet and Lassie and Shawn were standing in awkward silence until Lassie said, "He is cute Spencer. Not bad."

"Thanks Lassie." Shawn said.

Shawn went over to join Juliet and the chief with Juliet holding the baby. Shawn motioned for Lassiter to come join them. Now the chief was holding the baby.

"Would you like to hold him?" Karen asked.

Lassiter nodded. Lassiter pulled him up a chair and sat in it while he held the baby.

"Wow. Look at Carlton with a baby." Juliet whispered.

All three of them looked at Lassie and smiled.

"What?" Lassiter asked.

"Nothing I just noticed how good you are with babies." Juliet said.

Lassie looked down at Aaron and looked back up and said, "I guess I am. Who knew that?"

The chief and Lassiter stayed for a few more minutes before leaving to give the two some rest.

"Bye guys. I will see you one day next week." Juliet said.

"Well Baby Spencer, you are amazing." Shawn said bending down to grab his little fingers.

A tear rolled down Juliet's cheek.

"Can you believe it Shawn? We are finally parents?" Juliet said.

"I can now. He is amazing Jules." Shawn said.

"I am tired. Put him back in the crib please." Juliet said.

Shawn took Aaron and put him back in the crib and got in the bed with Juliet and also fell sleep.
