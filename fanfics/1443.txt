Pansy was prettiest when she was asleep.

Oh, Padma thought that Pansy was perfectly good-looking no matter her state of consciousness – a little thing like a pug nose didn't change her opinion – but there was something particular about the way she looked when she slept that was unusually endearing. Maybe it was the way her features seemed to soften, and the smirk that she usually wore faded away. Maybe it was the very small, very genuine smile that occasionally twitched on her lips. Maybe it was just that being asleep meant she wasn't saying anything irritating.

Whatever the reason, it was enough to make Padma want to stay in bed with Pansy all night, just so she could watch her.
